## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Sure! I can help you create a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python. We'll use the command line to display the game and get player inputs.

Here's a basic implementation of a two-player Tic Tac Toe game:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))
        print("-" * 5)

def check_winner(board, symbol):
    # Check rows, columns and diagonals for a win condition
    for i in range(3):
        if all([cell == symbol for cell in board[i]]):  # row check
            return True
        if all([board[j][i] == symbol for j in range(3)]):  # column check
            return True
    
    # Diagonal checks
    if (board[0][0] == symbol and board[1][1] == symbol and board[2][2] == symbol):
        return True
    if (board[0][2] == symbol and board[1][1] == symbol and board[2][0] == symbol):
        return True
    
    return False

def is_draw(board):
    # Check for a draw (no empty cells left)
    for row in board:
        if ' ' in row:
            return False
    return True

def play_game():
    board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
    current_player, next_player = "X", "O"
    
    while True:
        print_board(board)
        
        # Get input from the player
        try:
            row_choice = int(input(f"Player {current_player}, enter your move's row (0-2): "))
            col_choice = int(input(f"Player {current_player}, enter your move's column (0-2): "))
            
            if board[row_choice][col_choice] != ' ':
                print("Cell already filled. Try again.")
                continue
            
            # Place the player's symbol on the board
            board[row_choice][col_choice] = current_player
            
            if check_winner(board, current_player):
                print_board(board)
                print(f"Congratulations! Player {current_player} wins!")
                break
                
            if is_draw(board):
                print_board(board)
                print("The game is a draw!")
                break
                
            # Switch players
            current_player, next_player = next_player, current_player
        
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers between 0 and 2.")
    
play_game()
```
</div>

### How the Code Works:
1. **Board Initialization**: The game starts with an empty board initialized as a list of lists.
2. **Printing the Board**: A function to print out the current state of the board in a readable format.
3. **Checking for Winner**: Functions to check if either player has won by checking rows, columns, and diagonals for three consecutive symbols.
4. **Checking for Draw**: Function to determine if the game is a draw (no more moves left).
5. **Game Loop**: The main loop of the game where players take turns making moves until there's a winner or a draw.

To play the game:
- Run the script.
- Enter row and column numbers when prompted, starting with player "X".
- The board will update after each move, and the game ends when someone wins or it's a draw.
