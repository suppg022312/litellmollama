python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
<think>
Alright, I want to create a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to represent the game board. A 3x3 grid can be represented as a list of lists or maybe just a single list with 9 elements. Using a list might be simpler. So, I'll initialize a list with 9 empty strings or maybe use spaces to represent empty spots.

Next, I need to display the board to the user. I should write a function that prints the current state of the board in a readable format, like a grid with lines separating rows. For example, printing each row with elements separated by | and lines between them.

Now, handling player input is crucial. The player should enter a number corresponding to the position on the board. I need to make sure the input is validâ€”within 1-9 and not already occupied. So, I'll have a loop that keeps asking for input until it's valid.

I also need to check for the winner after each move. There are several winning combinations: rows, columns, diagonals. I can create a list of all possible winning lines and check if any of them are fully occupied by the same player (either 'X' or 'O'). If so, that player wins.

Another important aspect is checking for a tie. If the board is full and there's no winner, it's a tie.

I'll need functions for each part: displaying the board, checking for a winner, checking for a tie, and handling input.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize the game board as a list of 9 elements, maybe using ' ' to represent empty spots.
2. Define a function to print the current state of the board in a user-friendly way.
3. Create a loop that continues until there's a winner or a tie.
4. Within the loop, alternate turns between players (X and O).
5. For each turn, get the player's move input, validate it, update the board.
6. After updating, check if the current player has won. If yes, end the game with a message.
7. If not, check if the board is full. If yes, declare a tie.
8. If neither, continue to the next player.

I should also handle invalid inputs gracefully, like if the user enters a non-integer or a number outside 1-9, or a position already taken.

Testing is important too. I'll need to make sure all edge cases are covered, like a win on the last move, a tie when the board fills up, and correct handling of alternating turns.

I might structure the code with functions:

- display_board()
- get_player_input()
- check_winner()
- check_tie()
- main game loop

Let me start writing some pseudocode:

Initialize board = [' ' for _ in range(9)]

def display_board():
    print(f" {board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]} ")
    print("-----------")
    print(f" {board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]} ")
    print("-----------")
    print(f" {board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]} ")

def get_move(player):
    while True:
        try:
            move = int(input(f"Player {player}, enter position (1-9): ")) - 1
            if 0 <= move < 9 and board[move] == ' ':
                return move
            else:
                print("Invalid move. Try again.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 9.")

def check_winner():
    winning_lines = [
        [0, 1, 2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],
        [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],
        [0,4,8], [2,4,6]
    ]
    for line in winning_lines:
        a, b, c = line
        if board[a] == board[b] == board[c] != ' ':
            return board[a]
    return None

def check_tie():
    return ' ' not in board

Then, the main loop:

current_player = 'X'
while True:
    display_board()
    move = get_move(current_player)
    board[move] = current_player
    winner = check_winner()
    if winner:
        print(f"Player {winner} wins!")
        break
    if check_tie():
        print("It's a tie!")
        break
    current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

Wait, that might not be accurate. Because after X makes a move, it should switch to O and vice versa.

Testing the code:

- Start with board empty.
- Player X enters 1, then player O enters 2, etc.

Potential issues: The get_move function uses try-except but doesn't loop correctly if input is invalid. Maybe use a while loop that continues until valid move.

Another thing: in check_winner, after checking all lines, return the winner or None.

Also, make sure that the game stops when someone wins or it's a tie.

I think this structure should work. Now, I'll put it all together in code.

Here's a Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def display_board(board):
    for i in range(3):
        print(f" {board[i*3]} | {board[i*3+1]} | {board[i*3+2]} ")
        if i < 2:
            print("-----------")

def get_move(player, board):
    while True:
        try:
            move = int(input(f"\nPlayer {player}, enter position (1-9): ")) - 1
            if 0 <= move < 9 and board[move] == ' ':
                return move
            else:
                print("Invalid move. Try again.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 9.")

def check_winner(board):
    winning_lines = [
        [0, 1, 2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],
        [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],
        [0,4,8], [2,4,6]
    ]
    for line in winning_lines:
        a, b, c = line
        if board[a] == board[b] == board[c] != ' ':
            return board[a]
    return None

def check_tie(board):
    return ' ' not in board

def play_game():
    board = [' '] * 9
    current_player = 'X'
    while True:
        display_board(board)
        move = get_move(current_player, board)
        board[move] = current_player
        
        winner = check_winner(board)
        if winner:
            print(f"\nPlayer {winner} wins!")
            break
            
        if check_tie(board):
            print("\nIt's a tie!")
            break
            
        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
</div>

This code includes:

1. `display_board()` - Prints the current state of the board.
2. `get_move()` - Gets and validates player input.
3. `check_winner()` - Checks if any player has won.
4. `check_tie()` - Checks if the game is a tie.
5. `play_game()` - The main function that runs the game loop.

To play:
- Players take turns entering positions (1-9), corresponding to the board layout.
- After each move, the board updates and checks for a winner or tie.
- The game ends when someone wins or it results in a tie.

Example of how the board is displayed:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
 X |  O |  
-----------
   |    |
-----------
   |    |
```
</div>

The game continues until one player wins or all positions are filled (a tie).
