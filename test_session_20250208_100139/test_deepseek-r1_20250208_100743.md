python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
<think>
Alright, I need to create a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. Let me break it down into manageable steps.

First, the game board is a 3x3 grid. Maybe I can represent it as a list of lists or just a single string with positions separated by spaces. Using a list of strings might be easier for checking rows and columns.

Each cell can be 'X', 'O', or ' ' (space) indicating an empty spot. So, initializing the board with all spaces makes sense.

Next, I need to handle player input. Players will take turns entering their move numbers. I'll use a loop to keep asking until someone wins or the board is full. The moves should be validated to ensure they're within 1-9 and not already taken.

After each valid move, I update the board and check if the game has ended due to a win or a draw. If so, I display the final board and notify the player of the result.

Checking for a win involves looking at all rows, columns, and both diagonals. If any line has three of the same symbols (excluding spaces), that's a win.

I should also make sure that once someone wins, the game stops and shows the winner. If all spots are filled without a winner, it's a draw.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create the initial board setup.
2. Display the initial board.
3. Loop to handle each move:
   a. Get player input for their mark (X or O).
   b. Validate the input.
   c. Update the board with the new move.
   d. Check if there's a win or draw.
   e. If someone wins, display the result and break the loop.
4. If all spots are filled without a winner, declare it a draw.

I'll also need to alternate between players, starting with X, then O, etc. So I'll have a variable tracking whose turn it is.

For checking rows, columns, and diagonals, I can write a helper function that takes the board and the current player's mark and returns True if they've won.

Now, putting this into code:

- Initialize the board as a list of lists or strings. I think using a list where each row is a string separated by spaces would be manageable.
- Functions to check for a win and draw condition.
- Handling user input with proper validation.
- Displaying the board after each move.

I should test each part incrementally. For example, make sure the initial display looks correct, then ensure that placing a mark updates correctly, and that the win checking works for all possible lines.

Also, I'll need to handle cases where the same cell is selected again by either player, which should be invalid and prompt the user to enter another number.

Finally, once the game ends, show the final board and announce who won or if it's a draw.
</think>

Here's a Python implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
# Create an initial 3x3 empty board
board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

# Function to display the board
def show_board(board):
    print("   ".join(["   ".join(row) for row in board]))

# Initialize the game
show_board(board)

while True:
    # Determine current player's turn (X starts first)
    if len([cell for row in board for cell in row if cell == 'X']) >= 
        len([cell for row in board for cell in row if cell == 'O']):
        player = 'X'
    else:
        player = 'O'

    # Get the position from user input
    try:
        pos = int(input(f"Player {player}, enter your position (1-9): ")) - 1
        if not 0 <= pos < 9:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 9.")
            continue

        row = pos // 3
        col = pos % 3

        # Check if the position is already taken
        if board[row][col] != ' ':
            print("That position is already occupied. Try again.")
            continue

        # Update the board with current player's move
        board[row][col] = player

        # Check for a winner or draw after each move
        if check_win(board, player):
            show_board(board)
            print(f"Player {player} wins!")
            break

    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")

# Function to check if current player has won
def check_win(board, player):
    # Check rows and columns
    for i in range(3):
        if board[i][0] == board[i][1] == board[i][2] == player:
            return True
        if board[0][i] == board[1][i] == board[2][i] == player:
            return True

    # Check diagonals
    if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] == player:
        return True
    if board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] == player:
        return True

    return False
```
</div>

This implementation includes the following features:

1. A 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board represented as a list of lists.
2. Alternating turns between players X and O, starting with X.
3. Input validation to ensure players enter valid positions (1-9).
4. Checking for game win conditions after each move:
   - Three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
5. Game end conditions:
   - When a player wins by creating three consecutive marks.
   - When the board is full and no winner exists (draw).

The game runs in a loop where players take turns to place their marks on the board. After each move, it checks if there's a winning condition or if all positions are filled (resulting in a draw). The game continues until one of these conditions is met.

To play:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your player's position (1-9).
3. The game will alternate between players and display results after each move.
4. The game ends when someone wins or it becomes a draw.
