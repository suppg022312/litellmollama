## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Certainly! Below is a simple Python implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game. This version is quite basic and does not include advanced features like AI for the computer player or sophisticated graphics. However, it provides a solid starting point for understanding how such a game can be programmed.

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import os

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))
        print()

def check_win(board, symbol):
    win_patterns = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), 
                   (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8),
                   (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for pattern in win_patterns:
        if all(board[i] == symbol for i in pattern):
            return True
    return False

def play_game():
    board = [[" "] * 3 for _ in range(3)]
    player_turn = "X"  # Start with X

    while not check_win(board, player_turn):
        print_board(board)
        move_input = input(f"{player_turn}'s turn. Enter the position (row col): ")
        row, col = map(int, move_input.split())
        if 0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3 and board[row][col] == " ":  # Check validity of move
            board[row][col] = player_turn
            if check_win(board, player_turn):
                print(f"{player_turn} wins!")
                break
            if player_turn == "X":
                player_turn = "O"  # Switch to O
                print("It's O's turn now.")
            else:
                player_turn = "X"  # Switch to X

    print_board(board)  # Print final board
    if check_win(board, "X"):
        print("X wins!")
    elif check_win(board, "O"):
        print("O wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```
</div>

### Explanation

- **`print_board`**: A function to print the current state of the board.
- **`check_win`**: Checks if any player has won by matching the current board state against known win patterns.
- **`play_game`**: Handles the actual game loop. It alternates turns, validates moves, checks for wins, and switches between players until a winner is determined.

### Instructions

1. Save this script to a file, for example, `tictactoe.py`.
2. Run it using Python: `python tictactoe.py`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

This simple implementation can be expanded in many ways. For example, you could add AI for the computer player or implement a two-player mode. The code is quite modular, making it easy to expand upon. Enjoy your Tic Tac Toe game!

    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
