```

## Model Solution
<Thought>
Alright, I need to create a Python Tic Tac Toe game. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should decide whether to make it text-based or graphical. A text-based version is simpler and doesn't require additional libraries, so that might be the way to go.

Okay, so I'll start by setting up the game board. Maybe a 3x3 grid represented as a list of lists would work. Each cell can hold 'X', 'O', or be empty. I'll need functions to display the board, check for wins, and handle player moves.

For displaying the board, I'll create a function that prints the current state of the board in a readable format. I'll use nested loops to iterate through each row and column and print them accordingly.

Next, checking for wins. There are multiple ways a game can end: three 'X's or three 'O's in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. I'll need to check all these conditions after each move. If any of these conditions are met, the game should declare that player as the winner and exit.

Handling player moves requires taking input from the user. I'll prompt them to enter the position where they want to place their mark ('X' or 'O'). I'll need to validate the input to ensure it's within the bounds of the board and that the selected cell isn't already occupied. If the input is invalid, I'll prompt them again.

I should also consider handling the case when the game ends in a tie, meaning all cells are filled but no player has won yet. In this scenario, I'll declare it as a draw and end the game.

Maybe I'll add some enhancements like allowing players to choose whether they want to play first or second, but that's optional for now. Also, keeping track of the number of games played could be useful, but again, not essential for the basic version.

I need to think about edge cases. What if a player tries to enter a non-integer value? I'll have to handle exceptions and ensure the game doesn't crash. Also, ensuring that the board updates correctly after each move is crucial for gameplay fairness.

Perhaps adding comments to the code will help in understanding each part of the program. This way, anyone reading the code can follow along without much difficulty.

Alright, time to start coding. I'll begin by defining the initial board and then implement the display function. After that, I'll work on handling user input and updating the board accordingly. Once the basic functionality is in place, I'll add the win-checking logic.

Testing will be important too. I'll need to play through several games to ensure all conditions are correctly handledâ€”winning moves, invalid inputs, and ties. If I encounter any issues during testing, I'll debug by checking the logic step by step.

Maybe later on, I can enhance the game with features like AI opponents or different board sizes, but for now, focusing on the core functionality is best. Keeping it simple ensures reliability and makes future expansions easier to manage.
