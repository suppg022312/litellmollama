## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player paper-and-pencil game. There isn't an existing Python package specifically named "tic-tac-toe-game", but there are several ways to create and play Tic Tac Toe in Python.

Here's a basic example of how you could implement a text-based Tic Tac Toe game using Python:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def print_board(board):
    """Print the current state of the board."""
    for row in board:
        print(" ".join(row))

def check_win(board):
    """Check if there is a winner (three in a row) on the board."""
    win_states = [
        [board[0][0], board[0][1], board[0][2]],
        [board[1][0], board[1][1], board[1][2]],
        [board[2][0], board[2][1], board[2][2]],
        [board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0]],
        [board[0][1], board[1][1], board[2][1]],
        [board[0][2], board[1][2], board[2][2]],
        [board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]],
        [board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]]
    ]
    return any(win == ['X', 'X', 'X'] for win in win_states) or any(win == ['O', 'O', 'O'] for win in win_states)

def play_game():
    """Play a game of Tic Tac Toe."""
    # Initialize an empty board
    board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

    current_player = 'X'

    while True:
        print_board(board)
        
        # Get move input from the player
        row, col = map(int, input(f"Player {current_player}, enter row and column (e.g., 1 2): ").split())

        # Validate the move
        if board[row][col] != ' ':
            print("Invalid move! Try again.")
            continue
        
        # Make the move on the board
        board[row][col] = current_player

        # Check for win or draw
        if check_win(board):
            print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
            break
        elif all(cell != ' ' for row in board for cell in row):
            print("Draw!")
            break
        
        # Switch players
        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

# Start the game
play_game()
```
</div>

This script defines a simple text-based Tic Tac Toe game where users input their moves via the command line. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- `print_board` prints the current state of the board.
- `check_win` checks if there is a winner (three in a row) on the board.
- `play_game` controls the flow of the entire game, including taking player inputs and switching turns.

To play this game:

1. Run the script using your Python interpreter.
2. Follow the instructions printed by the program to make your moves.
3. The game will continue until there is a winner or a draw.

Please note that this implementation does not include additional features such as validating player input for out-of-range values, handling ties, or providing an option to replay the game after it ends. However, it can serve as a good starting point for more advanced implementations and modifications.

        elif all(cell != ' ' for row in board for cell in row):
            print("Draw!")
            break
        
        # Switch players
