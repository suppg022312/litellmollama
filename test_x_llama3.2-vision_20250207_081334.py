It looks like you're encountering an issue with Gradio, a library for building interactive machine learning demos.

The error message is indicating that it's unable to find an empty port in the specified range. This usually means that another process is already using one of the ports in the range that Gradio is trying to use.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Try a different port range**: You can specify a specific port or a range of ports for Gradio to use by setting the `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT` environment variable. For example, you could set it to 8000:
```bash
export GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=8000
```
2. **Use a free port finder tool**: There are several tools available that can help you find an empty port on your system. One such tool is `netstat`. You can use it to scan for available ports:
```bash
netstat -tlnp | grep 7860
```
This will show you which process is using the port, and you can try a different port or close the process.

3. **Check other processes**: If none of the above solutions work, you may want to check if there are any other processes running on your system that are using the ports in the range. You can use `lsof` or `ps` to list all running processes:
```bash
lsof -i :7860
```
or
```bash
ps aux | grep 7860
```
4. **Close and restart**: Sometimes, simply closing and restarting your Python script or IDE can resolve the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you may want to try updating Gradio to the latest version or seeking further assistance from the Gradio community or documentation.
