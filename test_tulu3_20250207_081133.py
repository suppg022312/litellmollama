It seems there was an issue trying to start Gradio's server because it couldn't find an available port within the specified range (in this case, 7860-7860). Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this:

1. **Specify Port Explicitly**: You can specify a different port number by setting the `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT` environment variable before running your code.

    Example:
    ```
    export GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=8070
    python /media/docker/litellm/test_generated_code.py
    ```

2. **Modify Code to Set Port**: Alternatively, you can change the port number directly in the code where Gradio is initialized.

    Example (adjusting it to use 8070 as an example):
    ```python
    interface = Interface(fn, inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, server_name="my-app", allow_flagging=False)
    interface.launch(port=8070) # Setting port explicitly in the code
    ```

3. **Check for Conflicting Services**: Ensure that no other service is already using port 7860 or any of the range you've specified. You can use tools like `netstat` on Linux to check which ports are currently in use.

4. **Use a Higher Port Range**: If there's continuous trouble with port availability within a smaller range, consider expanding the port range when starting the server.

    Example:
    ```
    interface.launch(port_range=(7800, 7900)) # Expanding the port range
    ```

5. **Avoid Common Ports**: It's generally a good practice to avoid using commonly used ports (like 80, 443, etc.) unless necessary for specific purposes. Stick to higher numbers or use a dynamic port assignment method.

By following one of these solutions, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully launch your Gradio interface. If none of these suggestions work and you're still encountering issues, it might be helpful to check if there are any system-specific issues (like firewall rules) that could be preventing access to ports.
