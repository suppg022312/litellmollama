## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python asteroids game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Creating an asteroid avoidance game in Python involves several steps. Here's a basic outline to get you started:

**Step 1: Set up your environment**
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

**Step 2: Write the Game Logic**

Below is a simple example of how to start an asteroid avoidance game in Python using Pygame, which is a popular library for creating video games.

First, you need to install Pygame:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```bash
pip install pygame
```
</div>

Here's a very basic template that sets up a window and handles key presses. It doesn't include the actual asteroids or graphics yet—it just provides a framework:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))

# Title and Icon
pygame.display.set_caption("Asteroid Avoidance")

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Update game state (e.g., player movement)
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
        # Move the ship to the left
        pass
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
        # Move the ship to the right
        pass
    
    # Draw everything here
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Fill the background black

    pygame.display.flip()

# Quit Pygame properly
pygame.quit()
```
</div>

**Step 3: Add Graphics and Asteroids**

To make this into a game with actual asteroids:

1. Load or create images for your player ship and asteroid(s).
2. Implement logic to spawn new asteroids at random positions.
3. Animate the asteroids by moving them across the screen.

Here's an enhanced version of the previous code snippet that includes basic asteroid spawning:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Define colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))

# Title and Icon
pygame.display.set_caption("Asteroid Avoidance")

# Player ship image - load or create an image for your player here
player_image = pygame.Surface((50, 50))
player_image.fill(WHITE)  # Simple rectangle representing the player

# Asteroid image(s)
asteroid_images = []  # Here you would load asteroid images
for i in range(5):  # Example: spawn 5 asteroids
    asteroid_img = pygame.transform.scale(player_image, (30, 30))  # Scale down for simplicity
    asteroid_x = 800 + random.randint(-1000, -200)  # Random x position off-screen to the right
    asteroid_y = random.randint(0, 600)  # Random y position
    asteroid_images.append((asteroid_img, (asteroid_x, asteroid_y)))

# Game loop
running = True
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

while running:
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Fill the background black

    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Update game state (e.g., player movement)
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    player_x_change = 0
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
        player_x_change -= 5
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
        player_x_change += 5
    
    # Move the player ship
    player_rect = player_image.get_rect(center=(400, 300))  # Start position in the center
    player_rect.x += player_x_change

    # Update asteroid positions
    for idx, (asteroid_img, pos) in enumerate(asteroid_images):
        pos = (pos[0] - 5, pos[1])  # Move each asteroid to the left by 5 pixels per frame
        screen.blit(asteroid_img, pos)

    # Draw the player ship
    screen.blit(player_image, player_rect)

    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the framerate at 60 FPS for smoothness
    clock.tick(60)

# Quit Pygame properly
pygame.quit()
```
</div>

This script will create a basic asteroid avoidance game. The asteroids move to the left across the screen, and you can control the player ship with the arrow keys.

**Step 4: Add Collision Detection**

To add collision detection:

1. Check if the player's position overlaps with an asteroid's.
2. Handle collisions by either removing the asteroid or ending the game if necessary.

Here's a rudimentary way to implement collision detection:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
# ...

def check_collision(player_rect, asteroids):
    """Check for collisions between player and asteroids."""
    for asteroid in asteroids:
        if player_rect.colliderect(asteroid[1]):  # 'player_rect' is the rect for player_image
            print("Collision!")
            running = False  # End the game

# Inside the main game loop, just before drawing everything:

# Update list of asteroids (move them)
new_asteroids = []
for idx, (asteroid_img, pos) in enumerate(asteroid_images):
    new_pos = (pos[0] - 5, pos[1])  # Move each asteroid to the left
    if new_pos[0] < 0:  # Off-screen; remove from list
        continue
    asteroids.append(new_pos)
    new_asteroids.append((asteroid_img, new_pos))

# Check for collision
player_rect = player_image.get_rect(topleft=(player_rect.x, player_rect.y))
check_collision(player_rect, [pos for _, pos in new_asteroids])

# Draw everything here

# ...
```
</div>

**Step 5: Refine and Expand**

This is a very basic implementation. You might want to:

- Improve visuals with actual images.
- Add scoring mechanics.
- Implement more complex asteroid spawning logic (different sizes, velocities).
- Add sound effects.

Remember to keep refining the code and adding features as you go along—game development is an iterative process!

**Important Note:**
The above example uses very simple collision detection which may not account for precise bounding box collisions especially when dealing with complex shapes like asteroids. For more accurate collisions, consider using `pygame.sprite.Group` and `pygame.sprite.collide_rect()` methods, or custom collision detection logic based on the actual asteroid images.

Lastly, game development can be a large endeavor; you'll likely need to split tasks into manageable parts and test each one thoroughly before integrating them all together. Enjoy your journey!
