It appears that you're encountering an error while trying to launch a Gradio server with a specified port range that is too narrow (only one port, 7860). The issue arises because the specified port range includes only one port (7860-7860), which logically contains no additional ports since 7860-7860 is only one specific port number repeated. 

Gradio requires a server to listen on a specific port for serving your interface. When you specify a range, it expects at least two distinct port numbers (e.g., 8000-8010). A single port number doesn as't qualify as a range.

**Solution:**

1. **Set a Different Port:** Choose a different port number outside the specified range (7860-7860) to avoid this conflict. For instance, you could set `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT` environment variable to any unused port like so:

   ```bash
   export GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=8080
   ```

   Or, when initializing your Gradio interface, specify a single port explicitly:

   ```python
   interface.launch(port=8080)
   ```

2. **Use a Valid Port Range:** If you really need to specify a range, ensure it contains at least two distinct port numbers. For example:

   ```python
   interface.launch(port_range=8000-8010)
   ```

Adjusting your approach according to these suggestions should resolve the issue. Remember, the chosen port must not be in use by another service to avoid conflicts. 

If you continue facing issues, ensure your application has the necessary permissions to bind to the specified ports, and no other process is already using them. You can check available ports on your system using `netstat` or `lsof` (on Unix-like systems) or with command-line tools specific to your operating system. 

By addressing the port range or selection issue, you should be able to successfully launch your Gradio interface without encountering the `OSError`.
