Here is a comprehensive Python project for an expense claim app. The code includes features like user authentication, database setup, and functionality for adding, viewing, and managing expense claims.


1. Dependencies:
The application requires several libraries to run successfully. The most important ones are Django, which is a popular web framework, Python-dateutil, used to manage dates and times, and xlrd, used to read Excel files. To install them using pip, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install django python-dateutil xlrd
```
2. Project Structure:
The project is structured into three main parts: models, views, and templates. The models folder contains all the necessary classes for the database tables, including the User class for managing user authentication. The views folder includes all the functions that handle HTTP requests and return responses. Lastly, the templates folder stores the HTML templates that are used to render web pages.

3. Database:
The application uses a PostgreSQL database. To create the database tables, execute the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
4. User Authentication:
To enable user authentication, Django provides an in-built auth system that allows you to create users and log them into the system. The User class in the models folder is extended from the django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser class, which provides a standard set of attributes for a user object. To create a new user, use the following code:
```
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

class User(get_user_model()):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=30, unique=True)
    email = models.EmailField(_('email address'), unique=True)
```
5. Expense Claim Model:
To manage expense claims, the application creates a new model called ExpenseClaim. The ExpenseClaim class includes attributes for the user who created the claim, the date it was submitted, and the total amount of the claim. To create the ExpenseClaim model, use the following code in the models folder:
```
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class ExpenseClaim(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    submitted_date = models.DateField()
    total_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
```
6. Views:
The views folder contains all the functions that handle HTTP requests and return responses. To create a new view for creating expense claims, use the following code:
```
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import ExpenseClaim

def create_expense_claim(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ExpenseClaimForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            expense_claim = form.save()
            return redirect('index')
    else:
        form = ExpenseClaimForm()
    return render(request, 'expenses/create_expense_claim.html', {'form': form})
```
7. Templates:
The templates folder stores all the HTML templates that are used to render web pages. To create a new template for creating expense claims, use the following code in the create_expense_claim.html file:
```
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Create Expense Claim</h1>
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form }}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
{% endblock %}
```
8. URLs:
To map URLs to views, Django uses the URLConf module. To create a new URL pattern for the expense claim view, use the following code in the urls.py file:
```
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('create_expense_claim/', views.create_expense_claim, name='create_expense_claim'),
]
```
9. Migrations:
To create the necessary tables in the database, Django provides a migration system. To generate the migrations for the expense claim model, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```
10. Running the Application:
To run the application, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
This will start the development server at http://localhost:8000/. You can then access the application by visiting this URL in your web browser.
