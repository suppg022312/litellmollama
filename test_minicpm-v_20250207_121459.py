Sure, here's a Python code snippet to create an AI agent that checks your Outlook Calendar for upcoming meetings:
```python
import win32com.client as wincl # required module for interacting with Windows COM objects like Outlook API
# Connect to the Outlook application and select calendar view
outlook = wincl.Dispatch("Outlook.Application")
outlook.Visible = True
calendar = outlook.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderCalendar)
# Define a function that sends an email notification if there are any upcoming meetings
def check_meetings():
    # Loop through all items in the selected folder (i.e., calendar view)
    for item in calendar.Items:
        # Check if the current date is within 3 days from today's date and it's not already completed meeting or has been attended by other people
        start_date = item.StartTime.Date
        end_date = item.EndTime.Date
        attendee_count = len(item.Attendees)
        if (start_date >= datetime.today() - timedelta(days=1) and 
            end_date <= datetime.today() + timedelta(days=2) and 
            attendee_count > 0):
            # Send a notification email to the user's inbox with details of upcoming meeting
            recipient = "user@example.com" # replace this with your actual email address where you want notifications sent to.
            subject = "Upcoming Meeting Notification"
            body = f"The following event has an upcoming meeting:\n\n{item.Name}\nStarts: {start_date}\nEnds: {end_date}"
            mail = outlook.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderSentMail)
            msg = olmsg.CreateItem(0) # create a new message object
            msg.To.Add(recipient, recipient)
            msg.Subject = subject
            msg.BodyType = 2
            msg.Body = body
            send_result = mail.Send(msg)
# Call the function to check for upcoming meetings every hour (optional: adjust this as per your needs)
while True:
    check_meetings()
```
Note that you'll need to have Outlook installed on your computer and be signed in with an account. Also, make sure to install `win32com.client` module by running the following command from a Python terminal or command prompt:
```css
pip install pywin32==279
```
