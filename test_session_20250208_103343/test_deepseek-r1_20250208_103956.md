## Model Solution
<think>
Alright, the user asked for a Python Tic Tac Toe game. I need to provide a clear and functional implementation.

First, I'll outline the main components of the game: a 3x3 board, players taking turns, checking for a win or tie, and displaying the board after each move.

I should represent the board using a list of lists for easy manipulation. Each cell can be 'X', 'O', or ' ' (space). Initializing the board with all spaces makes sense.

For player input, I'll need a function to get the current player's move. It should validate that the input is a number between 1 and 9. If not, it loops back to the user.

Checking for a win involves looking at rows, columns, and diagonals. I'll write a helper function for this, checking each possible winning combination.

Similarly, checking for a tie means all cells are filled with no winner. Another helper function will determine if the game has ended.

I'll handle the game loop by alternating turns between players until there's a winner or a tie. After each move, I'll display the updated board using a helper print_board function.

Finally, I'll include a welcome message and instructions on how to run the game, ensuring it's user-friendly.

Here's a simple Python Tic Tac Toe game:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def print_board(board):
    for i in range(3):
        print(f" {board[i*3]} | {board[i*3+1]} | {board[i*3+2]} ")
        if i < 2:
            print("-----------")

def check_win(board):
    # Check rows
    for i in range(0, 9, 3):
        if board[i] == board[i+1] == board[i+2] != " ":
            return True
    
    # Check columns
    for i in range(3):
        if board[i] == board[i+3] == board[i+6] != " ":
            return True
    
    # Check diagonals
    if board[0] == board[4] == board[8] != " " or \
       board[2] == board[4] == board[6] != " ":
        return True
    
    return False

def is_board_full(board):
    return ' ' not in board

def main():
    print("Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!")
    print("Enter positions (1-9) as shown below:")
    print(" 1 | 2 | 3 ")
    print("-----------")
    print(" 4 | 5 | 6 ")
    print("-----------")
    print(" 7 | 8 | 9 ")
    print()
    
    board = [" " for _ in range(9)]
    current_player = "X"
    
    while True:
        print_board(board)
        position = input(f"Player {current_player}, enter position (1-9): ")
        
        # Validate position
        try:
            position = int(position) - 1
            if position < 0 or position > 8:
                raise ValueError
            
            if board[position] != " ":
                raise ValueError
                
            board[position] = current_player
        
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Try again.")
            continue
        
        # Check for win
        if check_win(board):
            winner = current_player
            break
        
        # Check for tie
        if is_board_full(board) and not check_win(board):
            winner = "Tie"
            break
        
        # Switch players
        current_player = "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</div>

This game includes the following features:

1. A 3x3 board representation
2. Player input validation
3. Win condition checking
4. Tie detection (when all positions are filled and no winner)
5. Alternating turns between players
6. Clear board display after each move

To play:
1. The game starts with a welcome message and instructions
2. Players take turns entering positions (1-9)
3. After each move, the board is displayed
4. If someone wins, the game ends immediately
5. If all positions are filled without a winner, it's a tie

To run the game, simply execute the Python script:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
</div>
