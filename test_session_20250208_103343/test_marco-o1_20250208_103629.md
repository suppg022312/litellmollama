python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
<Thought>
Alright, I need to create a Python Tic Tac Toe game. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should decide whether to make it a console-based game or have a graphical user interface (GUI). A console-based game is simpler and easier to implement, so maybe that's the way to go for now.

Okay, so in Tic Tac Toe, there are two players: one plays with X and the other with O. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their symbol in empty squares until someone gets three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the grid is full and the game ends in a draw.

I should start by setting up the board. A list of lists can work for that, where each sublist represents a row on the 3x3 grid. Initially, all cells are empty, so I'll represent them with spaces or underscores.

Next, I need to display the current state of the board to the players. This means printing out the grid in a readable format, probably using loops to iterate through each cell and print it accordingly.

Then, I need to handle player input. Since it's console-based, I'll prompt the user to enter their move. The move can be represented by coordinates like row and column numbers. I should validate the input to ensure it's within the bounds of the grid and that the chosen cell isn't already occupied.

After each move, I need to check if there's a winner or if the game has ended in a draw. To do this, I'll write functions to check rows, columns, and diagonals for three identical symbols. If any condition is met, the game ends, and the player who won should be announced.

I also need to alternate turns between players. This can be handled by using a loop that continues until there's a winner or a draw.

Additionally, it might be useful to implement an option for the second player to choose whether they want to play first or let the computer decide. For simplicity, I'll assume the first player always goes first.

Error handling is important too. If a player enters an invalid move, the program should prompt them again without crashing. This means using try-except blocks around input prompts and ensuring that non-integer inputs are handled gracefully.

Maybe I can also add some enhancements, like allowing players to play multiple games in a row or resetting the board between games. But for now, I'll focus on getting the basic game working correctly.

Alright, let's start coding step by step:

1. Initialize the board.
2. Display the board.
3. Get player input and update the board.
4. Check for win conditions after each move.
5. Alternate turns until there's a winner or it's a draw.

I should also consider edge cases, like what happens if both players enter invalid moves repeatedly. Implementing proper loop control will help manage that.

Okay, time to write some code. I'll define functions for displaying the board, getting and validating input, checking for wins, and switching turns. This modular approach will make the code cleaner and easier to debug.

Once the basic game is working, I can think about adding more features or optimizing it further. But for now, the core functionality should suffice.
