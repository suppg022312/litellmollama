## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Sure! Let's create a simple command-line version of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. This version will support two players taking turns to play against each other.

Hereâ€™s how we can break down the process:

1. **Create the Board**: We need to represent the board and display it.
2. **Player Moves**: Allow players to input their moves.
3. **Check for Wins or Draws**: After each move, check if a player has won or if the game is a draw.

Let's start with the basic code structure:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def print_board(board):
    """Prints the current state of the board."""
    print("\n".join([" | ".join(row) for row in board]))
    print("-" * 5)

def check_win(board, player):
    """Checks if the given player has won."""
    win_conditions = [
        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
        [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)],
        [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)],

        [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)],
        [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)],
        [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)],

        [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)],
        [(0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0)]
    ]
    
    for condition in win_conditions:
        if all(board[x][y] == player for x, y in condition):
            return True
    return False

def is_draw(board):
    """Checks whether the board is full and no winner."""
    return all([all(cell != ' ' for cell in row) for row in board])

def main():
    # Initialize an empty 3x3 board with spaces.
    board = [[' ']*3 for _ in range(3)]
    
    current_player = "X"
    
    while True:
        print_board(board)
        
        try:
            row = int(input(f"Player {current_player}, enter your move (row): "))
            col = int(input("Enter your move (column): "))
            
            if board[row][col] != ' ':
                print("Cell already occupied, please choose another one.")
                continue
            
            # Make the move
            board[row][col] = current_player
            
            if check_win(board, current_player):
                print_board(board)
                print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
                break
                
            if is_draw(board):
                print_board(board)
                print("The game is a draw.")
                break

            # Switch player
            current_player = "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"

        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print("Invalid input. Please enter row and column numbers from 0 to 2.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</div>

### Explanation:
- **print_board(board)**: This function prints the current state of the game board.
- **check_win(board, player)**: Checks if a given player has won based on all possible winning combinations in Tic Tac Toe.
- **is_draw(board)**: Determines whether the game is drawn by checking if all cells are filled without any winner.
- **main()**: Handles user input and updates the board state. It also checks for wins or draws after each move.

### How to Play:
1. The game will start with player "X".
2. You'll be prompted to enter row and column numbers (0, 1, or 2) to place your symbol.
3. After every move, the game checks if there's a winner or a draw.

Feel free to modify this code as per your needs or add more features such as AI opponents for single-player mode!
