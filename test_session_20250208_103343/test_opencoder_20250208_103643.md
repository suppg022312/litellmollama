## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python tic tac toe game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Sure, here is a simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Python using the built-in console for user input:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python

# Define a function to draw the Tic Tac Toe board
def draw_board(board):
    print('---------')
    for i in range(3):
        print('|', board[i][0], '|', board[i][1], '|', board[i][2], '|')
        print('---------')

# Initialize the game board
board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
current_player = 'X'

# Define a function to check if there is a winner
def check_winner(board):
    for i in range(3):
        if (board[i][0] == board[i][1] == board[i][2]) and (board[i][0] != ' '): 
            return True # row win condition
        elif (board[0][i] == board[1][i] == board[2][i]) and (board[0][i] != ' '):
            return True # column win condition
    if (board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2]) and (board[0][0] != ' '):
        return True # diagonal win condition 1
    elif (board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0]) and (board[0][2] != ' '):
        return True # diagonal win condition 2

    return False # no winner yet

# Start the game loop
while True:
    draw_board(board)
    
    if current_player == 'X':
        print('Player X\'s turn')
    else:
        print('Player O\'s turn')

    row = int(input('Enter row: '))
    col = int(input('Enter column: '))

    # Check if the chosen square is free
    if board[row][col] != ' ':
        print('That square is already occupied. Choose another one.')
        continue

    # Update the game board with the current player's move
    board[row][col] = current_player

    # Switch to the other player
    current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

    # Check for a winner
    if check_winner(board):
        draw_board(board)
        print('Player', current_player, 'wins!')
        break

    # Check if there are any free squares left
    free_squares_left = False
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if board[i][j] == ' ':
                free_squares_left = True
                break
        if free_squares_left: 
            break

    # If no one has won yet and there are no free squares left, it's a draw
    if not free_squares_left:
        draw_board(board)
        print('It\'s a draw!')
        break

```
</div>
Please note that this is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game. It doesn't have AI to play against or any fancy graphics. Also, player inputs are based on counting from 0.
