Creating a complete Asteroids game in Python with Streamlit is quite an involved task, but I can certainly guide you through a simplified version to get you started. This example will include basic components like a spaceship, asteroids, and a shooting mechanism. Due to the limitations of this medium, I'll provide a basic conceptual outline along with essential code snippets.

First, ensure you have Streamlit and Pygame installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit pygame
```

Here’s how you can structure your `main.py` file to set up a simple Asteroids game using Streamlit and Pygame:

```python
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *
import streamlit as st
import time

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Asteroids Game")

# Colors
black = (0, 0, 0)
white = (255, 255, 255)
red = (213, 50, 80)
green = (0, 255, 0)

# Ship constants
SHIP_SIZE = 50
ship_pos = [WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2]
ship_img = pygame.image.load("ship.png")  # Replace with your ship image path

def main():
    game_running = True
    
    while game_running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == QUIT:
                game_running = False

        # Clear screen
        screen.fill(black)
        
        # Draw ship
        screen.blit(ship_img, ship_pos)
        
        # Check for collisions (Simplified for the example)
        for asteroid in asteroids:  # Placeholder; replace with actual loop
            if ship_pos[0] + SHIP_SIZE >= asteroid[0] and ship_pos[0] <= asteroid[0] + asteroid[1]:
                game_running = False

        pygame.display.update()
        
        # Simplified animation logic
        if st.button("Shoot"):
            # Logic to shoot and remove asteroids goes here
            pass

        # Pause for frame rate control
        time.sleep(1 / 30)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st.title("Asteroids Game")
    main()
```

### Key Points:

- **Setup**: Pygame is used for the game logic and drawing because Streamlit does not natively support real-time game graphics in its current state (as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023).
- **Clear Screen**: `screen.fill(black)` clears the screen each frame.
- **Drawing Ship**: Your ship image is loaded and drawn to the center of the screen each frame.
- **Collision Detection**: A basic check for collisions with asteroids is provided. Replace the placeholder with actual asteroid handling logic.
- **Shoot Mechanism**: When the "Shoot" button in Streamlit is clicked, you would implement logic to actually shoot at and destroy asteroids.
- **Animation**: The `time.sleep(1 / 30)` simulates a 30 FPS frame rate.

### Notes:

1. **Images**: You will need to provide paths to images for the ship (`ship.png`) and asteroids in the appropriate location relative to your script.
2. **Complexity**: This example is a very basic framework. A full Asteroids game would involve more sophisticated collision detection, shooting mechanics, scoring, asteroid breakup mechanics, sound, etc.
3. **Streamlit Integration**: Streamlit is primarily used here for UI elements like the "Shoot" button. Streamlit’s capabilities are currently limited in real-time interactive gaming due to its focus on data applications. For a fully featured game, you might want to consider using more traditional game development frameworks or engines.

To run your application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start your Asteroids game in a local web server that you can access through your web browser.

This simplistic example is intended to guide you to start creating your game. Filling in the blanks with full logic, more detailed game mechanics, and handling player input more precisely will turn it into a fully functional game.
