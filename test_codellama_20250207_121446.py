Here is a sample code that checks your Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings and sends you emails in advance:
```
import win32com.client

# Create an instance of the Outlook Application object
outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch('Outlook.Application')

# Get the name of the user's default calendar
calendar_name = outlook.Session.GetDefaultFolder(15).Name

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()

# Set the start and end dates for the search
start_date = now + datetime.timedelta(days=7)
end_date = now + datetime.timedelta(days=14)

# Search for meetings in the next two weeks
meetings = outlook.Session.GetDefaultFolder(15).Items.Restrict(["[Start] >= '" + start_date + "' AND [End] <= '" + end_date + "'"]).FindNext()

# Loop through the results and send an email to each participant
for meeting in meetings:
    # Get the list of participants for this meeting
    participants = []
    for attendee in meeting.Recipients:
        participants.append(attendee.Name)
    
    # Create a new Outlook mail item
    email = outlook.CreateItem(0)
    
    # Set the subject and body of the email
    email.Subject = "Upcoming Meeting Reminder"
    email.Body = "There is an upcoming meeting on " + meeting.Start + ". Please be sure to attend."
    
    # Add the participants to the email
    for participant in participants:
        email.Recipients.Add(participant)
    
    # Send the email
    email.Send()
```
This code uses the `win32com` library to interact with Outlook, and the `datetime` module to handle dates and times. It searches for meetings in the next two weeks using the `Restrict` method, and then loops through each meeting and sends an email to each participant using the `CreateItem`, `Subject`, `Body`, and `Send` methods.

You will need to have Outlook installed on your computer and configured with Python to use this code. Additionally, you may need to adjust the date range and other settings depending on your specific requirements.
