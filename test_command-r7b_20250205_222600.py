Creating a complete Asteroids-like game from scratch is a complex project that requires knowledge of game development, programming, and various libraries or engines. Here's a simplified version using Python and the Pygame library to get you started:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**

First, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

**Step 2: Create the Game Structure**

Create a new directory for your project and set up the basic structure:
```
asteroids_game/
    game.py
    graphics.py (or similar)
    settings.py
    main.py
```

**Step 3: Basic Game Logic (game.py)**

Start with the core logic in `game.py`:
```python
import pygame, sys
from settings import *
from player import Player
from asteroids import Asteroids

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.init()
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.player = Player(0, 5)
        self.asteroids = [Asteroids(10, 10), Asteroids(30, 40)]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    pygame.quit()
                    sys.exit()

            self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
            self.player.update()
            self.asteroids = [a.update(self.player) for a in self.asteroids]

            # Collision detection and player movement
            ...
            pygame.display.flip()
            self.clock.tick(FPS)
```

**Step 4: Player Class (player.py)**

Create a separate file `player.py` to define the player's behavior:
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        ...

    def update(self):
        # Player movement logic here
        pass
```

**Step 5: Asteroids Class (asteroids.py)**

Similarly, create a file `asteroids.py` for asteroid behavior:
```python
class Asteroids:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        ...

    def update(self, player_pos):
        # Movement and collision detection logic here
        pass
```

**Step 6: Game Settings (settings.py)**

Create a `settings.py` file to define constants:
```python
WIDTH = 800
HEIGHT = 600
FPS = 60
```

**Step 7: Main Entry Point (main.py)**

Finally, create a main entry point in `main.py`:
```python
import pygame
from game import Game

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.run()
```

This is just a basic outline to get you started. You'll need to implement collision detection, asteroid spawning, player controls, and more advanced features like scoring, levels, and sound effects for a full-fledged game. Pygame's documentation (https://www.pygame.org/docs/) will be an invaluable resource throughout the development process.

Remember that game development is iterative; you'll likely need to experiment, debug, and refine your code as you build upon these initial steps. Good luck with your Asteroids-inspired game!
