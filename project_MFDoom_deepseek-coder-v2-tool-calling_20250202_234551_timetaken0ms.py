Creating a complex expense tracking application involves several steps, including setting up the database, designing an intuitive user interface, and implementing robust backend logic. Below is a simplified example using Python with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. This example will include basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for expenses, categorization, and reporting features.

### Step 1: Setup Your Project
First, create a new directory for your project and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
mkdir expense_tracker
cd expense_tracker
python3 -m venv venv
