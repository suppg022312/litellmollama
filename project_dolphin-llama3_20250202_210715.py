Here's a basic outline of the Python project you could work on:

1. Create a database to store user information and expense details.
2. Build a command-line interface (CLI) using Python's built-in `argparse` module to allow users to interact with your application.
3. Implement functions for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing expenses based on the CLI commands.
4. Use the `datetime` module to automatically track the date and time of each expense entry.
5. Create reports that summarize user expenses by category or timeframe.
6. Add data validation to ensure users enter valid information when creating new expenses.
7. Implement a feature to calculate the total amount spent within a given period.

Don't forget to test your code thoroughly!
