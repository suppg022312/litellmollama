## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
a python and streamlit expenses web app
```
</div>

## Model Solution
  Great! Here are some potential features for your Python and Streamlit Expenses Web App:

1. Create an account: Users can create an account on your web app to access their expenses data, which will allow them to view and manage their expenses.
2. Enter expenses: Users can enter their expenses using a streamlined form that asks for the date of purchase, the amount spent, and the category of the purchase (e.g., groceries, entertainment, etc.).
3. View expenses: Users can view all of their entered expenses in a table format with columns for date, amount, category, and notes (if applicable).
4. Filter expenses: Users can filter their expenses by category or date range to find specific transactions quickly and easily.
5. Delete expenses: Users can delete individual transactions from the app if they are no longer relevant.
6. View totals: Users can view a total of all their expenses for each category, which can help them track their spending over time.
7. Share expenses: Users can share their expenses with others by sending them a link to the app or exporting their data in a CSV format.
8. Customize categories: Users can customize the categories they use to organize their expenses, which can be helpful if they have specific needs or preferences.
9. Receipt scanning: Users can scan receipts directly into the app using the camera on their device, which will automatically fill in the date and amount of the purchase.
10. Budgeting: Users can set a budget for each category and receive notifications if they exceed it, which can help them stay within their means and avoid overspending.
