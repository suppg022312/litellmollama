## Original Task
```
tell me how to create a python spaceinvaders game with python code 
```

## Model Solution
## Introduction

Creating a Space Invaders game from scratch can be an extensive project, but I'll guide you through the basic structure and key components of such a game using Python. This tutorial will walk you through setting up a simple version of Space Invaders using Pygame, a popular library for game development in Python.

## Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Then, install `pygame`:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Setting Up The Game Environment

Firstly, let's set up the basic structure of our project. We'll create a file named `space_invaders.py`.

```python
# space_invaders.py

import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()
```

## Display and Event Handling

Next, we initialize the display and handle events.

```python
# Define some constants
WIDTH = 800
HEIGHT = 600

# Initialize game window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption('Space Invaders')

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    
    # Clear the screen
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    
    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()
```

## Player Ship

Now let's add a player ship to our game.

```python
# Player Ship
player_ship_speed = 5
ship_width = 50
ship_height = 20

class PlayerShip:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = (WIDTH - ship_width) // 2
        self.y = HEIGHT - ship_height - 10
        self.image = pygame.Surface((ship_width, ship_height))
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(topleft=(self.x, self.y))

    def move(self, direction):
        self.rect.x += direction * player_ship_speed
    
player = PlayerShip()
```

And include it in the game loop:

```python
# ... inside while running:
for event in pygame.event.get():
    # ... (previous event handling)

    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
            player.move(-1)
        elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
            player.move(1)

    # ... (rest of the game loop)

# Draw the player ship
pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), player.rect)
```

## Space Invaders

To add invaders, aliens, and logic for moving and shooting them is quite complex and goes beyond this markdown. However, I'll outline how to start:

1. **Create an Alien Class**: Similar to the `PlayerShip`, create a class for aliens with methods to move them across the screen.
2. **Initialize Aliens**: Place several alien instances on the top row of the screen.
3. **Game Logic**:
   - Move the aliens down and left/right based on your game logic.
   - Handle collisions between player shots and invaders.
   - Update scores, pause the game, etc.

## Full Example

Below is a very simplified example combining everything above into one code block:

```python
import pygame
import sys

pygame.init()

WIDTH = 800
HEIGHT = 600

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption('Space Invaders')

player_ship_speed = 5
ship_width = 50
ship_height = 20

class PlayerShip:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = (WIDTH - ship_width) // 2
        self.y = HEIGHT - ship_height - 10
        self.image = pygame.Surface((ship_width, ship_height))
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(topleft=(self.x, self.y))

    def move(self, direction):
        self.rect.x += direction * player_ship_speed

player = PlayerShip()

running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                player.move(-1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                player.move(1)

    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), player.rect)
    
    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
sys.exit()
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't include aliens or shooting mechanics. Implementing those features would significantly increase the complexity of your code.

## Next Steps

To fully develop Space Invaders:
- Add `Alien` class with similar properties as `PlayerShip`.
- Implement movement logic for Aliens.
- Add player shot mechanic (create a bullet class).
- Handle collisions and update game state accordingly.
- Include scoring, Lives, Game Over screen.

This tutorial should serve as a good starting point. Developing Space Invaders will be an iterative process of adding features and refining gameplay. Good luck!
