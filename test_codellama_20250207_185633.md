## Original Task
```
tell me how to create a python spaceinvaders game with python code 
```

## Model Solution

---

### Introduction

Python Space Invaders is a classic arcade game that has been implemented many times. In this task, we will go over how to create a simple Python Space Invaders game using PyGame library. The game will have basic features like controlling the spaceship with arrow keys and shooting aliens with space bar.

---

### Installing PyGame Library

Before we start creating our game, let's install the PyGame library. To do this, open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
```
pip install pygame
```
This will install the PyGame library on your computer. If you are using Anaconda, you can use the following command to install it:
```
conda install -c conda-forge pygame
```
---

### Creating a Python File

Next, create a new Python file and name it as you wish (e.g., `space_invaders.py`). This will be the main file where we will write our code for the game.

---

### Importing Libraries

In the first line of our Python file, we need to import the PyGame library. Add the following line at the top of your file:
```python
import pygame
```
This imports the necessary libraries for creating a window and rendering images on it.

---

### Setting Up the Game Window

Next, let's set up the game window by defining its size, title, and other parameters. Add the following code at the top of your file:
```python
# Initialize PyGame
pygame.init()

# Setup display
screen_width = 640
screen_height = 480
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# Set title of the window
pygame.display.set_caption('Space Invaders')
```
This initializes PyGame and sets up a display window with a size of 640x480 pixels. The title of the window is set to "Space Invaders".

---

### Creating Images

Now, let's create images for our game elements like spaceship, aliens, and bullets. Add the following code at the top of your file:
```python
# Load images
spaceship_img = pygame.image.load('spaceship.png')
alien1_img = pygame.image.load('alien1.png')
alien2_img = pygame.image.load('alien2.png')
bullet_img = pygame.image.load('bullet.png')
```
This loads images from the file system and stores them in variables for later use. Make sure to replace the image file names with your own.

---

### Creating Sprites

Next, we need to create sprites for our game elements. Add the following code at the top of your file:
```python
# Create sprites
spaceship = pygame.sprite.Sprite()
aliens = []
bullets = []
```
This creates a sprite object for the spaceship and empty lists for aliens and bullets.

---

### Spaceship Movement

Now, let's add movement controls to our spaceship. Add the following code after the `spaceship` variable:
```python
# Set up movement controls
move_left = False
move_right = False
move_up = False
move_down = False

def update_movement(key):
    global move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down
    if key == pygame.K_LEFT:
        move_left = True
    elif key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
        move_right = True
    elif key == pygame.K_UP:
        move_up = True
    elif key == pygame.K_DOWN:
        move_down = True

def update(dt):
    global spaceship, move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down
    
    # Update movement
    if move_left:
        spaceship.rect.x -= 5
    elif move_right:
        spaceship.rect.x += 5
    if move_up:
        spaceship.rect.y -= 5
    elif move_down:
        spaceship.rect.y += 5
```
This creates functions for updating movement controls and updating the position of the spaceship based on those controls.

---

### Alien Movement

Next, let's create a function to update the positions of aliens on the screen. Add the following code after the `update_movement` function:
```python
def update_aliens(dt):
    global aliens
    
    # Update position
    for alien in aliens:
        alien.rect.x += 5
        
    # Check if any aliens are out of bounds
    for alien in aliens:
        if alien.rect.x > screen_width - alien.rect.width:
            alien.rect.x = screen_width - alien.rect.width
```
This function updates the position of each alien in the `aliens` list by 5 pixels on each iteration. It also checks if any aliens are out of bounds and adjusts their positions accordingly.

---

### Shooting Bullets

Next, let's add functionality to shoot bullets from our spaceship. Add the following code after the `update_aliens` function:
```python
def update_bullets(dt):
    global bullets, spaceship
    
    # Update position
    for bullet in bullets:
        bullet.rect.y -= 5
        
    # Check if any bullets are out of bounds
    for bullet in bullets:
        if bullet.rect.y < 0:
            bullet.kill()
    
    # Shoot bullet if space bar is pressed
    if pygame.key.get_pressed()[pygame.K_SPACE]:
        new_bullet = pygame.sprite.Sprite()
        new_bullet.image = bullet_img
        new_bullet.rect = pygame.Rect(spaceship.rect.x, spaceship.rect.y - 5, 10, 10)
        bullets.append(new_bullet)
```
This function updates the position of each bullet in the `bullets` list by 5 pixels on each iteration. It also checks if any bullets are out of bounds and removes them from the list. Additionally, it adds a new bullet to the list when the space bar is pressed.

---

### Drawing Images

Finally, let's add code to draw our game elements on the screen. Add the following code at the end of your file:
```python
def draw_sprites(screen):
    global spaceship, aliens, bullets
    
    # Draw background
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    
    # Draw sprites
    for sprite in [spaceship] + aliens + bullets:
        screen.blit(sprite.image, sprite.rect)
        
# Main game loop
while True:
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            sys.exit()
    
    # Update movement and bullets
    update_movement(pygame.key.get_pressed())
    update_aliens(dt)
    update_bullets(dt)
    
    # Draw sprites
    draw_sprites(screen)
```
This code creates a main game loop that handles events, updates movement and bullets, and draws all the sprites on the screen. The `draw_sprites` function is responsible for drawing the background, spaceship, aliens, and bullets on the screen.

---

### Running the Game

Finally, let's run our game! Add the following code at the end of your file:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    pygame.init()
    
    # Setup display
    screen_width = 640
    screen_height = 480
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
    
    # Run game loop
    while True:
        draw_sprites(screen)
        
        # Handle events
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                sys.exit()
```
This code initializes the `pygame` library, sets up the display, and runs the main game loop. The main game loop is responsible for drawing all the sprites on the screen and handling events.

---

And that's it! You now have a basic space shooter game using Pygame.
