1. Project Plan:

The project will be a comprehensive expense claims application that allows users to input their expenses, categorize them, and submit the claims. The application will also provide features for managing and tracking expenses over time.

2. Database Design:

The application will use a relational database to store user data, expense categories, and individual expense details. A SQLite database will be used due to its simplicity and efficiency.

3. User Interface:

The application will have two main interfaces - a dashboard for users to view their current expenses and a claims section where users can submit their claims. The dashboard will also display user activity over time.

4. Code Structure:

The project will be structured using Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. Each feature of the application will have its own class, with inheritance and polymorphism used to create a modular and maintainable codebase.

5. Features:

   - User Registration and Login: Users will be able to register and login to the application. They will also be able to reset their passwords if needed.

   - Expense Management: Users will be able to add, edit, and delete their expenses. Each expense will have a unique identifier, name, amount, category, and date.

   - Claim Submission: Users will be able to submit their claims by providing the necessary details and selecting the claim type (e.g., groceries, dining out, etc.). The application will then store this information in the database for future reference.

   - User Activity Tracking: The application will track user activity over time, such as how often users add or edit expenses, and when they submit their claims. This data can be used to generate reports and analytics.

   - Security: The application will use secure coding practices to protect user data. This includes encrypting sensitive information in the database and using secure connections (HTTPS) for all API requests.

6. Testing:

The application will be thoroughly tested using a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This will ensure that each feature works as expected and that the application is robust and reliable.

7. Deployment:

The application will be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud. This will allow users to access the application from anywhere with an internet connection and ensures that the application can scale as needed.

8. Maintenance and Updates:

The application will be regularly updated to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance. The team will also monitor user activity and make changes as needed to ensure the application remains useful and secure over time.
