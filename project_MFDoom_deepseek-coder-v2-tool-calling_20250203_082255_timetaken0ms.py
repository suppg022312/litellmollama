Sure! Below is a simple Python application using the `tkinter` library to create a basic expenses form app. This app will allow users to input their expenses, and it will display them in a list box. The user can then remove individual items or clear all entries.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox, Listbox, END

class ExpensesFormApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Expenses Form App")
        
        # Create and place widgets
        self.create_
