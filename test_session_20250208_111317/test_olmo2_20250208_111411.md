## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python expenses app
```
</div>

## Model Solution
Creating a simple Python script to track expenses involves setting up a basic application where you can add, display, and possibly even search through your expenses. Below is an outline of how you might structure such an application. This example uses a dictionary to store expenses with dates as keys and amounts as values. For simplicity, we won't include database interactions or advanced features like searching.

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
# Simple Expenses Tracker App in Python

def start_app():
    # Initialize the expense tracker
    expenses = {}

    def add_expense(amount, date):
        """Add an expense to the tracker."""
        expenses[date] = expenses.get(date, 0) + amount
    
    def view_expenses():
        """View all expenses with their dates and amounts."""
        for date, amount in expenses.items():
            print(f"{date}: ${amount}")

    def end_app():
        """End the app gracefully."""
        print("Exiting the app...")

    # Main menu
    while True:
        print("\nExpenses Tracker")
        print("---------------------")
        print("1. Add Expense")
        print("2. View Expenses")
        print("3. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            add_expense(float(input("Enter the expense amount: ")), input("Enter the date (dd-mm-yyyy): ")))
        elif choice == "2":
            view_expenses()
        elif choice == "3":
            end_app()
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

# Start the application
start_app()
```
</div>

This script begins by initializing an empty dictionary to store expenses, with dates as keys and amounts as values. The `add_expense` function is used to add a new expense to the tracker, `view_expenses` displays all recorded expenses, and `end_app` concludes the session.

To run this script:

1. Copy the entire code into a `.py` file, for example, `expenses_tracker.py`.
2. Save the file.
3. Run the script using Python: `python expenses_tracker.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

The script will enter a loop for selecting actions:

- `1` to add a new expense
- `2` to view all expenses
- `3` to exit the app

Make sure to follow good programming practices, such as handling exceptions (e.g., invalid input types) and considering the use of more advanced data structures or libraries if your application grows in complexity. This simple example can be expanded upon to include features like filtering expenses by category, handling recurring expenses, or storing data persistently with a database.

Remember, for any real-world application, you would need to consider aspects like user authentication, data security, and validation, which are not covered in this basic example.
