## Original Task
```
create me a python based space invaders game

```

## Model Solution
## Space Invaders Game in Python

Creating a simple version of the classic Space Invaders game requires understanding basic game mechanics and graphics manipulation in Python. For this demonstration, we'll use Pygame, a set of modules designed for writing games in Python. Before proceeding, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with Pygame.

### **Installation Instructions**

**Step 1:** Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Step 2:** Install Pygame
    - On Windows: Use [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create an executable if you wish to avoid setting up a development environment.
    - On macOS: Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installation:
        ```
        brew install python3
        pip3 install pygame
        ```
    - On Linux (Ubuntu):
        ```
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
        pip3 install pygame
        ```

### **Setting Up Pygame**

```python
# Importing necessary modules
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
width, height = 800, 480
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))

# Colors
black = (0, 0, 0)
white = (255, 255, 255)

# Game objects
player_x = width / 2
player_y = height - 100

invaders = [
    [50, 50],
    [100, 50],
    [150, 50],
    [200, 50],
    [250, 50]
]

bullets = []

clock = pygame.time.Clock()

def check_collision(object1, object2):
    """Check for collision between two objects"""
    return not (object1[0] > object2[0] or object1[1] < object2[1])

def draw_invaders(screen, invaders):
    """Draw invaders on the screen"""
    for x, y in invaders:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, black, [x, y, 10, 10])

def update_positions(player_x, player_y, bullets, invaders):
    """Update player and bullets positions"""
    player_y += 5
    for bullet in bullets:
        bullet[1] += 5
        if bullet[1] > height:
            bullets.remove(bullet)
    for invader in invaders:
        if check_collision(invader, (player_x, player_y)):
            invaders.pop()

def game_loop():
    """Main game loop"""
    running = True
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False

        # Clear the screen
        screen.fill(white)

        # Draw the player
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, black, [player_x, player_y, 10, 10])

        # Draw invaders
        draw_invaders(screen, invaders)

        # Update positions
        update_positions(player_x, player_y, bullets, invaders)

        # Check if the player won or lost
        if not invaders:
            print("Player wins!")
        elif player_y <= 0:
            print("Game Over. Press Q to quit.")

        # Display the frame
        pygame.display.flip()

        # Cap the framerate at 60 FPS
        clock.tick(60)

    pygame.quit()
    quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game_loop()
```

### **Explanation**

- **Initialization:** Pygame is initialized and configurations for the screen, colors, and initial positions are set up.
- **Game Objects:** The player, invaders, and bullets are initialized with their starting positions.
- **Collision Check:** A function checks for collisions between the player and invaders.
- **Drawing:** Functions are defined to draw the player, invaders, and bullets on the screen.
- **Game Loop:** The main loop manages events, clears the screen, draws game objects, updates their positions, handles game over conditions, and caps the frame rate.

### **Usage**

To run this game:

1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
2. Save the code to a file named `space_invaders.py`.
3. Run the game from your command line or terminal:
   - On Windows: `python space_invaders.py`
   - On macOS/Linux: `python3 space_invaders.py`

The game will start, and you can control the player with keyboard input (move up to move the player ship). The objective is to avoid the invaders while shooting them down. 

This simple version of Space Invaders provides a starting point for more complex features like levels, scoring, and enemy behavior variation.
