Creating a complete Space Invaders game in Python from scratch is quite an extensive project that goes beyond a simple text response. However, I can guide you through setting up a basic version of it using the Pygame library.

### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install Pygame with pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Basic Space Invaders Setup

**Step 1: Initialize Pygame**

Create a new file named `space_invaders.py` and start by initializing Pygame.

```python
import pygame
import time
import random

pygame.init()
```

**Step 2: Define Constants**

Next, define some constants for things like screen dimensions, colors, etc.

```python
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
RED = (213, 50, 80)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
BLUE = (50, 153, 213)

# Ship settings
SHIP_WIDTH = 30
SHIP_HEIGHT = 40

# Bullet settings
BULLET_WIDTH = 5
BULLET_HEIGHT = 15
BULLET_VELOCITY = -10

# Invaders settings
INVADER_WIDTH = 20
INVADER_HEIGHT = 20
INVADER_ROWS = 4
INVADER_COLS = int(SCREEN_WIDTH / INVADER_WIDTH)
INVADER_VELOCITY = 3

# Game variables
ship_x = SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.5
ship_y = SCREEN_HEIGHT - SHIP_HEIGHT - 10
bullet_state = "ready"

# List to hold the invaders
invaders = []

for col in range(INVADER_COLS):
    alien = pygame.Rect(col * INVADER_WIDTH + (INVADER_WIDTH - SHIP_WIDTH) / 2,
                        50,
                        INVADER_WIDTH, INVADER_HEIGHT)
    invaders.append(alien)
```

**Step 3: Initialize Game Window**

Create the main game window.

```python
# Create screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

pygame.display.set_caption('Space Invaders')

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    # Fill the background
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    
    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    
    # Ship movement (arrow keys)
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT] and ship_x > 0:
        ship_x -= 5
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT] and ship_x < SCREEN_WIDTH - SHIP_WIDTH:
        ship_x += 5

    # Draw the ship
    ship = pygame.Rect(ship_x, ship_y, SHIP_WIDTH, SHIP_HEIGHT)
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, ship)

    # Update screen
    pygame.display.update()
    time.sleep(0.01)  # This delays each frame slightly

pygame.quit()
```

**Step 4: Add More Features**

This code provides a basic setup for a Space Invaders game:

- **Player Ship**: Moves left and right.
- **Game Loop**: Handles events and updates the screen.

To continue, you would need to add:
- **Bullet System**: Allow player to shoot bullets and hit invaders.
- **Invader Movement**: Make invaders move down and sideways when shots are fired.
- **Collision Detection**: Handle collisions between bullets and invaders (and possibly the ship).
- **Game Over Logic**: End the game when all invaders are destroyed or the ship is hit.

**Resources for Further Learning:**
- The [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) provides comprehensive guides on creating games.
- Online tutorials and YouTube videos can provide detailed step-by-step instructions to build a full Space Invaders game from scratch.

This basic setup should get you started. Remember, game programming is an iterative process of building, testing, and refining your code. Good luck!
