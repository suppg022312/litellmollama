Creating an Asteroids-like game using Python can be quite fun, and integrating it with Streamlit for a web-based interface is a cool idea! However, since creating a full-fledged game is extensive and beyond the scope of a simple response here, I'll provide you with a simplified version that focuses on demonstrating how to integrate basic game functionality into a Streamlit app.

Firstly, you need to install the necessary packages. If you haven't already set up your Python environment for this project, start by installing `streamlit` and other dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pygame
```

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Game

Let's create a basic Asteroids game using Pygame in Python. This is the core of our game logic which we will later integrate with Streamlit.

Create a file named `asteroids_game.py` and add this code:

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = pygame.Surface((40, 40), pygame.SRCALPHA)
        pygame.draw.polygon(self.image, WHITE, [(18, 39), (24, 25), (36, 25), (27, 18),
                                                (39, 18), (27, 0), (36, 0), (24, 12)])
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center=(WIDTH // 2, HEIGHT // 2))
        self.speed = 5
        self.angle = 0

    def update(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.angle -= 3
        elif keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.angle += 3
        self.image = pygame.transform.rotate(pygame.Surface((40, 40), pygame.SRCALPHA), self.angle)
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center=self.rect.center)

        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
            x_speed = math.cos(math.radians(self.angle)) * self.speed
            y_speed = -math.sin(math.radians(self.angle)) * self.speed
            self.rect.x += int(x_speed)
            self.rect.y += int(y_speed)

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.display.set_caption("Asteroids")
        self.player = Player()
        self.all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group((self.player,))

    def run(self):
        running = True
        while running:
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    running = False

            screen.fill(BLACK)
            self.all_sprites.update()
            self.all_sprites.draw(screen)

            pygame.display.flip()

            clock.tick(60)  # Frame rate
```

### Step 2: Integrate with Streamlit

Now, let's create a Streamlit app that runs this game. Create another file named `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_echarts import JsCode
import pygame
from threading import Thread
import os
from PIL import Image
import time

# Load the game function
def load_game():
    exec(open("asteroids_game.py").read())

# Initialize Streamlit app
st.title('Asteroids Game')

if st.button('Start Game'):
    # Start the game in a separate thread to keep streamlit running
    def start_pygame_thread():
        os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'windib'  # For Windows, might need modification for other OS
        pygame.init()
        load_game()

    t = Thread(target=start_pygame_thread)
    t.start()

# Placeholder for game display (for demonstration purposes)
st.write("The Asteroids Game is running in a separate window.")
```

### Running Your App

To run your app:

1. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
2. Run Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

This will start your Streamlit application, and clicking "Start Game" should launch your Asteroids game in a Pygame window.

### Notes

- This is an introductory example for integrating a simple game with Streamlit.
- The actual rendering of the game inside Streamlit would require more advanced techniques like using websockets or dedicated libraries for embedding games.
- The threading approach here is rudimentary and might need adjustments based on your specific requirements and environment configurations.

Enjoy coding and playing!
