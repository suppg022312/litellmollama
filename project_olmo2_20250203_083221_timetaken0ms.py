Certainly! Below is a basic example of how you could structure an expenses form application in Python. This example will use simple command-line input and output for simplicity. For a more advanced application, you might consider using a graphical user interface (GUI) library such as `tkinter` or ` PyQt5`.

```python
import argparse

# Define the expense class to hold expense details
class Expense:
    def __init__(self, category, amount):
        self.category = category
        self.amount = amount

def main():
    # Parse command line arguments for categories and amounts
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Expenses Form')
    parser.add_argument('category', type=str, help='Expense category')
    parser.add_argument('amount', type=float, help='Expense amount')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Create an expense object based on the input
    expense = Expense(args.category, args.amount)

    # Print out the expense information
    print(f"Category: {expense.category}")
    print(f"Amount: {expense.amount}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To use this script:

1. Save the code in a file named `expenses_form.py`.
2. Run the script using Python by typing `python expenses_form.py` in your command line or terminal.
3. When prompted, enter the category and amount of your expense.

Here is how the command-line interaction might look:

```sh
$ python expenses_form.py
Category: Groceries
Amount: 50.00
```

And the output will be:

```
Category: Groceries
Amount: 50.00
```

This is a very basic version of an expenses form app. For a more complete application, you might want to consider saving this data to a file or a database for future reference. You could also add functionality for multiple expenses, error handling, and more detailed reporting.

To save expenses to a file, you could modify the script like this:

```python
import argparse
import csv

# Define the expense class to hold expense details
class Expense:
    def __init__(self, category, amount):
        self.category = category
        self.amount = amount

def main():
    # Parse command line arguments for categories and amounts
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Expenses Form')
    parser.add_argument('category', type=str, help='Expense category')
    parser.add_argument('amount', type=float, help='Expense amount')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Create an expense object based on the input
    expense = Expense(args.category, args.amount)

    # Write to a CSV file
    with open('expenses.csv', 'a', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow([expense.category, expense.amount])

    # Print out the expense information
    print(f"Category: {expense.category}")
    print(f"Amount: {expense.amount}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version saves each expense as a new row in a CSV file named `expenses.csv`, which makes it easy to view or analyze the expenses with a spreadsheet program.

Remember, for real-world applications, you should handle exceptions and user inputs more robustly than this example does.
