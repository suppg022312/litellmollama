Okay, so the user wants a Python script to create an AI agent that checks their Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings and emails them in advance. Let me break down how I can approach this.

First, I need to access the Outlook calendar data. Microsoft Graph API seems like the way to go since it's designed for such interactions. So, I'll have to use the Microsoft Python client library, probably msgraph-sdk-python. That means I'll need to set up an app in Azure Portal to get the necessary credentials, like a client ID and secret.

Next, authorization is key. The user will need to sign in using their Outlook account, so I'll implement OAuth2 authentication within the script. This involves redirecting the user to a login page where they grant permissions to the app. Once authenticated, the app can access their calendar data.

Now, fetching upcoming meetings. I'll use the Graph API endpoint for events in the user's calendar. The task is to retrieve events that are coming up, maybe within the next week. I should make sure to handle pagination if there are a lot of events, so looping through all pages of results might be necessary.

Once I have the events, I need to process each one and send an email as a reminder. Using Python's smtplib library would work for sending emails. But wait, using Outlook's SMTP server directly might require setting up an app password in the account settings. Alternatively, perhaps using Graph API to send emails through Microsoft Teams or another channel could be considered, but sticking with smtplib seems straightforward.

I should structure the script so it runs at a specific interval. Maybe using a scheduler like APScheduler would allow the script to check for new meetings periodically without manual intervention. This means setting up an event loop that triggers the main function every hour or as needed.

Putting this all together, the script will:

1. Authenticate with Microsoft Graph.
2. Fetch upcoming events from the calendar.
3. For each event, send a reminder email via smtplib.
4. Schedule the script to run periodically to check for new meetings.

I also need to consider error handlingâ€”what if there's no internet connection or authentication fails? Adding try-except blocks and logging errors would be important for robustness.

Lastly, I should remind the user about the necessary permissions in Azure App Registration and any required scopes for accessing the calendar. Maybe provide a note on how to set up app passwords for Outlook accounts since that's a common setup step.

Overall, breaking down each component and ensuring smooth integration between Graph API, email sending, and scheduling should make this script effective for the user's needs.

Here's an example of a Python script that checks your Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings using Microsoft's Graph API and sends you an email reminder. This requires setting up authentication with Microsoft:

```python
from msgraphsdk import GraphClient
import smtplib
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_outlook_calendar_events(access_token):
    """Get upcoming events from Outlook calendar"""
    # Initialize Graph client
    graph_client = GraphClient(credential=access_token)
    
    try:
        # Get events in the next 7 days
        end_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7)
        events = graph_client.users('me').calendar_view(
            start=datetime.now(), 
            end=end_time.isoformat()
        ).get()

        return events.value
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting calendar events: {e}")
        return None

def send_reminder_email(email_subject, email_body, recipient):
    """Send an email reminder"""
    try:
        # Set up your Outlook email server details
        smtp_server = 'smtp.office365.com'  # For Office365/Outlook
        smtp_port = 587
        sender_email = 'your@email.com'
        password = 'your_app_password'  # App password generated in Outlook

        # Connect to the SMTP server
        mail = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
        mail.ehlo()
        mail.starttls()
        mail.ehlo()

        # Login with your email credentials
        mail.login(sender_email, password)

        # Send the email
        message = f"Subject: {email_subject}\n\n{email_body}"
        mail.sendmail(sender_email, recipient, message)
        
        logger.info("Email reminder sent successfully")
        mail.close()
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to send email: {e}")

def main():
    # Set up your Microsoft Graph API credentials
    client_id = 'your_client_id'  # From Azure Portal
    client_secret = 'your_client_secret'  # From Azure Portal
    tenant_id = 'your_tenant_id'  # Your organization's ID

    # Authenticate with Microsoft Graph
    from msgraphsdk.authentication import ClientCredentialProvider
    provider = ClientCredentialProvider(client_id, client_secret, tenant_id)
    
    access_token = provider.get_access_token()
    
    # Get upcoming events
    events = get_outlook_calendar_events(access_token)
    
    if events:
        logger.info(f"Found {len(events)} upcoming meetings")
        
        for event in events:
            subject = event.subject or 'No Subject'
            start_time = event.start.datetime.isoformat()
            
            # Set reminder time (e.g., 30 minutes before the meeting)
            reminder_time = event.start.datetime - timedelta(minutes=30)
            
            # Send email
            send_reminder_email(
                f"Reminder: {subject}",
                f"Hi, this is a reminder for your upcoming meeting: {event.subject}. "
                f"The meeting starts at {start_time}. Don't forget to attend!",
                event.attendees[0].email_address.address  # Send to first attendee
            )
            
    else:
        logger.info("No upcoming meetings found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Instructions:

1. **Set Up Microsoft Graph API Access:**
   - Register your application in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Enable the Calendar.Read scope.
   - Get your `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `tenant_id`.

2. **Set Up Email Credentials:**
   - Replace `'your@email.com'` with your Outlook email address.
   - Generate an App Password in Outlook for use with SMTP.

3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install msgraphsdk python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Save this script and run it periodically (you can add a cron job or use APScheduler to run it at regular intervals).

### Notes:

- This script requires proper authentication with Microsoft Graph API.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your Azure app registration.
- You may need to adjust the email sending logic based on your specific needs.
- The script checks for events up to 7 days in advance.

You can enhance this script by:
- Adding more detailed logging
- Implementing error handling
- Adding configuration management
- Adding scheduling (use APScheduler or another scheduler)
- Adding notifications via other channels (e.g., Slack, Teams)

Remember to handle credentials securely and follow best practices for authentication.
