Creating a fully functional Asteroids game in Python can be quite involved, but I'll provide you with a basic implementation using the Pygame library. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

First, make sure you have Pygame installed. You can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install pygame
```

Now, let's create a simple version of the Asteroids game. This will include basic functionality such as player movement, shooting, and asteroid generation.

Here is the complete code for a basic Asteroids game in Python:

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# Colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# Player settings
PLAYER_SIZE = 40
PLAYER_SPEED = 5

# Asteroid settings
ASTEROID_SIZE = 30
ASTEROID_SPEED = 2
NUM_ASTEROIDS = 10

# Create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Asteroids")

# Load player image
player_image = pygame.image.load("player.png")
player_rect = player_image.get_rect()
player_rect.center = (SCREEN_WIDTH // 2, SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2)

# Load asteroid image
asteroid_images = [pygame.image.load(f"asteroid_{i}.png") for i in range(1, 4)]
asteroids = []

for _ in range(NUM_ASTEROIDS):
    asteroid = {
        "rect": pygame.Rect(random.randint(0, SCREEN_WIDTH - ASTEROID_SIZE), random.randint(0, SCREEN_HEIGHT - ASTEROID_SIZE),
                            ASTEROID_SIZE, ASTEROID_SIZE),
        "speed_x": random.choice([-1, 1]) * ASTEROID_SPEED,
        "speed_y": random.choice([-1, 1]) * ASTEROID_SPEED
    }
    asteroids.append(asteroid)

# Player movement variables
player_move_left = False
player_move_right = False
player_move_up = False
player_move_down = False

# Game loop
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
running = True

while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                player_move_left = True
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                player_move_right = True
            elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                player_move_up = True
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                player_move_down = True
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                player_move_left = False
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                player_move_right = False
            elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                player_move_up = False
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                player_move_down = False

    # Update player position
    if player_move_left and player_rect.left > 0:
        player_rect.x -= PLAYER_SPEED
    if player_move_right and player_rect.right < SCREEN_WIDTH:
        player_rect.x += PLAYER_SPEED
    if player_move_up and player_rect.top > 0:
        player_rect.y -= PLAYER_SPEED
    if player_move_down and player_rect.bottom < SCREEN_HEIGHT:
        player_rect.y += PLAYER_SPEED

    # Update asteroid positions
    for asteroid in asteroids:
        asteroid["rect"].x += asteroid["speed_x"]
        asteroid["rect"].y += asteroid["speed_y"]

        # Wrap around screen edges
        if asteroid["rect"].left > SCREEN_WIDTH:
            asteroid["rect"].left = 0 - ASTEROID_SIZE
        elif asteroid["rect"].right < 0:
            asteroid["rect"].right = SCREEN_WIDTH
        if asteroid["rect"].top > SCREEN_HEIGHT:
            asteroid["rect"].top = 0 - ASTEROID_SIZE
        elif asteroid["rect"].bottom < 0:
            asteroid["rect"].bottom = SCREEN_HEIGHT

    # Clear the screen
    screen.fill(BLACK)

    # Draw player
    screen.blit(player_image, player_rect)

    # Draw asteroids
    for asteroid in asteroids:
        screen.blit(asteroid_images[random.randint(0, len(asteroid_images) - 1)], asteroid["rect"])

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    clock.tick(60)

# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()
sys.exit()
```

### Notes:
1. **Player and Asteroid Images**: You need to provide `player.png` and `asteroid_1.png`, `asteroid_2.png`, and `asteroid_3.png` images in the same directory as your script.
2. **Collision Detection**: This basic version does not include collision detection between the player and asteroids, nor does it handle shooting or scoring.
3. **Game Over**: The game will continue running indefinitely until you close the window.

To add more features like shooting, collision detection, and scoring, you would need to extend this code significantly.
