Creating a full-fledged Asteroids game is a complex task that requires a significant amount of time and resources. However, I can provide you with a basic structure and some key components to help you get started on your own project. Here's a step-by-step guide using Python, the Pygame library for game development, and the World Wind API for 3D rendering:

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
   - Create a new directory for your project and set up a virtual environment if you prefer not to use pip and virtualenv.

2. **Create the Basic Structure:**
   - Import necessary libraries and create a simple window for your game.
   - Set up the game loop, including keyboard input handling, game logic updates, and rendering.

3. **Implement the Basic Game Mechanics:**
   - Implement the asteroid collision logic using Pygame's sprite objects and collision detection functions.
   - Add power-ups that spawn randomly when the player collides with an asteroid. These power-ups can provide temporary bonuses like increased speed, shields, or fuel.

4. **Create a 3D Rendering Environment:**
   - Install World Wind API: `pip install worldwind`
   - Set up Pygame's World Wind environment to render your game in 3D space. You'll need to create a 3D camera, set up the viewpoint, and add meshes for the asteroids and other objects.

5. **Add Visual Effects:**
   - Implement effects like explosions, fire, or atmosphere lighting using Pygame's functions.

6. **Implement Advanced Features (Optional):**
   - Add game over screens, power-ups that affect multiple astronauts or asteroids, and other features to enhance the overall experience.

7. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Regularly test your game during development and fix any issues that arise. Pygame's logging functionality can be helpful for debugging.

Remember, creating a full-fledged Asteroids game is a time-consuming task. It's essential to prioritize features and break the project into smaller, manageable tasks. Good luck! If you need more assistance or have specific questions about any part of the process, feel free to ask.
