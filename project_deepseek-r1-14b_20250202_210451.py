Okay, the user wants to create a complex Python project for an expenses claim app. Let's break down what that entails.

First, I need to outline the main features such an app should have. It should allow users to log in, track their expenses with details like date, description, amount, and category. Categorizing expenses helps in tracking different types of spending. Adding receipts would be useful for documentation, so integrating image uploads makes sense.

Approval by admins is another key feature. This means the app needs a user role systemâ€”admins versus regular users. Notifications would keep users informed about the status of their claims. Generating reports and visualizations will help users and admins analyze spending trends.

Now, thinking about the project structure. Using Django seems appropriate because it's great for building web apps with a clear structure. I'll start by creating a new Django project and then add necessary apps like authentication, expenses, receipts, notifications, and reporting.

Authentication is crucial. I'll use Django's built-in auth system but extend it to include roles (admin vs user) and maybe a profile model for additional user info. Custom signals can handle things like welcome emails or setting default user roles.

For the expenses app, models will represent claims and their details. Each claim can have multiple expense items, each with date, description, amount, and category. Categories should be a separate model to allow dropdown selection. Foreign keys will link these together.

Receipts need to handle file uploads. Using a FileField in Django models allows storing images or PDFs. I'll ensure that receipts are linked to specific expense items for easy reference.

Approval workflow is next. Admins should view claims, and upon approval, send notifications to users. This requires admin views where they can see all pending claims, along with details like total amount and submission date.

The notification system should be decoupled so it can handle different types of messages. Using a decorator or signal to trigger notifications when a claim is approved would streamline this process. Storing notifications in the database allows users to view their history.

Reporting features need to generate both textual and visual data. Utilizing libraries like matplotlib or chart.js can help create graphs. Summarizing expenses by category and date will provide useful insights. Views for generating reports should be secure, perhaps requiring admin access.

Testing is important for reliability. Writing unit tests and integration tests using Django's testing framework ensures that each component works as expected. Mocking data where necessary helps isolate test environments.

Finally, deployment considerations are essential for making the app accessible. Using Docker containerizes the application, making it easy to deploy on platforms like Heroku or AWS. Configuration files should be managed properly to avoid exposing sensitive information.

Putting this all together, I'll outline each step from setting up the project and models to views, testing, and deployment. Providing code snippets with explanations helps the user understand each part of the implementation.

I'll help you create a comprehensive Python expenses claim app using Django. This will include:

1. User authentication
2. Expense tracking
3. Receipt management
4. Approval workflow
5. Reporting features
6. Notifications

Here's a step-by-step guide to building this project:

### 1. Project Setup

Create a new Django project:

```bash
django-admin startproject expensetracker
cd expensetracker
```

Add the following apps:
- `authentication` (for user management)
- `expenses` (for handling expense claims)
- `receipts` (for managing receipts attached to expenses)
- `notifications` (for handling notifications)
- `reporting` (for generating reports)

```bash
python manage.py startapp authentication
python manage.py startapp expenses
python manage.py startapp receipts
python manage.py startapp notifications
python manage.py startapp reporting
```

### 2. Authentication App

This app will handle user registration, login, and roles.

**models.py**

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class User(AbstractUser):
    ROLES = (
        ('ADMIN', 'Admin'),
        ('USER', 'User'),
    )
    
    role = models.CharField(max_length=5, choices=ROLES, default='USER')
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    is_approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```

**forms.py**

```python
from django import forms
from .models import User

class RegistrationForm(forms.ModelForm):
    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)
    
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['username', 'email', 'role', 'password']
```

### 3. Expenses App

This app will handle expense claims.

**models.py**

```python
from django.db import models
from authentication.models import User

class ExpenseCategory(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class ExpenseItem(models.Model):
    date = models.DateField()
    description = models.TextField()
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    category = models.ForeignKey(ExpenseCategory, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    claimed_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    receipt = models.ImageField(upload_to='receipts/%Y/%m/%d', blank=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.date} - {self.description}"

class Claim(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    total_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    submission_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=10,
        choices=(
            ('PENDING', 'Pending'),
            ('APPROVED', 'Approved'),
            ('REJECTED', 'Rejected')
        ),
        default='PENDING'
    )
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user.username} - {self.submission_date}"
```

### 4. Admin Interface

Register your models in the admin interface.

**admin.py**

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import ExpenseCategory, ExpenseItem, Claim

admin.site.register(ExpenseCategory)
admin.site.register(ExpenseItem)
admin.site.register(Claim)
```

### 5. Views and Templates

Create views for:

- User registration
- Logging in/out
- Submitting expenses
- Viewing expense history
- Admin approval workflow

**views.py (expenses)**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .models import ExpenseItem, Claim
from authentication.models import User

def submit_expense(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle form submission
        pass
    return render(request, 'submit_expense.html')

def view_claims(request):
    claims = Claim.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'view_claims.html', {'claims': claims})

def approve_claim(request, claim_id):
    claim = Claim.objects.get(id=claim_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        claim.status = 'APPROVED'
        claim.save()
        # Trigger notification
        create_notification('Claim Approved', f'Your claim has been approved.', claim.user)
        return redirect('view_claims')
    return render(request, 'approve_claim.html', {'claim': claim})
```

### 6. Notifications

Create a separate app for handling notifications.

**models.py (notifications)**

```python
from django.db import models
from authentication.models import User

class Notification(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    message = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user.username} - {self.created_at}"
```

**views.py (notifications)**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Notification

def view_notifications(request):
    notifications = Notification.objects.filter(user=request.user).order_by('-created_at')
    return render(request, 'view_notifications.html', {'notifications': notifications})
```

### 7. Reporting

Generate reports and visualizations.

**views.py (reporting)**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import io
from django.http import HttpResponse

def generate_expense_report(request):
    # Generate some data
    categories = ['Transport', 'Food', 'Entertainment', 'Other']
    amounts = [100, 200, 300, 400]
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
    plt.bar(categories, amounts)
    plt.title('Monthly Expense Report')
    plt.ylabel('Amount ($)')
    
    # Save the plot to a buffer
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    plt.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)
    
    return FileResponse(buf, content_type='image/png')
```

### 8. Testing

Write tests for your application.

**tests.py (expenses)**

```python
import pytest
from django.urls import reverse
from .models import ExpenseItem, Claim

@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_submit_expense(client):
    user = User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', email='test@example.com')
    client.force_login(user)
    
    response = client.post(reverse('submit_expense'), {
        'date': '2023-10-01',
        'description': 'Test expense',
        'amount': 100.00,
        'category': 1
    })
    
    assert ExpenseItem.objects.count() == 1
```

### 9. Deployment

To deploy your application, you can use:

- **Docker**: Create a Docker container with Django.
- **Heroku**: Deploy to Heroku using Git.
- **AWS**: Use AWS services for hosting and database.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.6+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (optional)

### Conclusion

This is a basic implementation of an expense reporting system. You can expand it by adding:

- More detailed user roles
- Advanced reporting features
- Integration with external APIs
- PDF exports
- Email notifications
- Data import/export capabilities

Remember to always keep your code secure and follow best practices for database queries, authentication, and session management.
