Creating a full-featured Asteroids game involves several complex components such as graphics, user input handling, collision detection, and more. Below is a simplified version of an Asteroids game in Python using the `pygame` library, which provides functionality for creating video games.

### Setup

Before you start, make sure you have pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Basic Asteroids Game with Pygame

Here's a basic outline of how to create a simplified Asteroids game. This version will include:

- A spaceship that can move and rotate.
- Randomly moving asteroids.
- Simple collision detection.

**Game Script: `asteroids_game.py`**

```python
import pygame
import random
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Define some colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

# Screen dimensions
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600

# Game objects
ship_image = pygame.image.load("ship.png")  # Load your ship image
asteroid_image = pygame.image.load("asteroid.png")  # Load your asteroid image

class Ship(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = ship_image
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = (WIDTH // 2, HEIGHT // 2)
        self.angle = 0
    
    def rotate(self, direction):
        self.angle += direction * 5
        self.image = pygame.transform.rotate(ship_image, self.angle)

class Asteroid(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, pos=(random.randint(0, WIDTH), random.randint(0, HEIGHT))):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = asteroid_image
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center=pos)
        self.speed = (random.uniform(-1, 1), random.uniform(-2, -1))  # Random speed

    def update(self):
        self.rect.x += self.speed[0]
        self.rect.y += self.speed[1]

# Game initialization
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption('Asteroids')
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
ship = Ship()
all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group(ship)
asteroid_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group()

# Create some asteroids for the start
for _ in range(5):
    Asteroid()

def check_collision():
    # Simple collision detection: ship and asteroids
    if pygame.sprite.spritecollide(ship, asteroid_sprites, True):
        print("Game Over")
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    
        # Key events
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            ship.rotate(-1)  # Rotate left
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            ship.rotate(1)   # Rotate right
        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
            pass  # Thrust, you might implement this
    
    all_sprites.update()

    check_collision()
    
    all_sprites.draw(screen)
    asteroid_sprites.draw(screen)

    pygame.display.flip()

    clock.tick(60)  # Limit to 60 frames per second

pygame.quit()
```

### Notes:
- You need to provide your own ship and asteroid images (named `ship.png` and `asteroid.png`) in the same directory as this script.
- This version is very basic; it doesn't include features like shooting, explosion effects, scoring systems, or sophisticated movement/collision detection. 
- For a more comprehensive game, you would need to further develop each component: player controls (thrusters), firing lasers, asteroid splitting on collision, and more complex AI for the asteroids.
- The `check_collision` function is very simple and only ends the game when the ship collides with an asteroid. Realistically, you'd want to handle collisions in a way that destroys the asteroid and maybe damages/destroys the ship.

This code provides a starting point; building a full Asteroids game will require expanding this foundation significantly.
