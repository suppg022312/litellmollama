## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python pontoon game
```
</div>

## Model Solution
Sure! A "Pontoon" game is similar to Blackjack but with its own unique rules and strategies. Here's a basic implementation of a Pontoon game in Python for two players: the player and the dealer (computer). This example will include functions to deal cards, check scores, and handle betting and insurance.

Firstly, you need to set up some basics such as card values and deck management:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import random

# Card values dictionary with special cards having specific values
card_values = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7,
               '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'J': 10, 'Q': 10, 'K': 10, 'A': [1, 11]}

# Define the suits
suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']

# Create a full deck of cards
def create_deck():
    deck = []
    for suit in suits:
        for rank in card_values.keys():
            deck.append((rank, suit))
    return deck

# Shuffle the deck
def shuffle_deck(deck):
    random.shuffle(deck)

# Deal cards from the deck
def deal_cards(deck, number_of_cards=1):
    cards_dealt = []
    for _ in range(number_of_cards):
        card = deck.pop()
        cards_dealt.append(card)
    return cards_deald

# Function to calculate the score of a hand
def get_score(hand):
    total = 0
    num_aces = 0
    for card, suit in hand:
        if card == 'A':
            num_aces += 1
        else:
            total += card_values[card]
    
    # Check possible scores with and without aces counting as 11
    score_with_ace_as_1 = total + (num_aces * 1)
    score_with_ace_as_11 = total + (num_aces * 11)
    if score_with_ace_as_1 > 21:
        return score_with_ace_as_11
    else:
        return max(score_with_ace_as_1, score_with_ace_as_11)

# Function to check if a hand is Pontoon (Ace and a ten-value card)
def is_pontoon(hand):
    if len(hand) != 2 or 'A' not in [card for card, suit in hand] \
            or any(card not in ['10', 'J', 'Q', 'K'] for card, suit in hand):
        return False
    return True

# Example usage
deck = create_deck()
shuffle_deck(deck)

player_hand = deal_cards(deck)
dealer_hand = deal_cards(deck)

print(f"Player's hand: {player_hand} with score: {get_score(player_hand)}")
print(f"Dealer's hand (first card): {dealer_hand[0]}")  # Dealer shows only one card initially
```
</div>

This basic framework covers dealing cards, shuffling the deck, and calculating scores for a Pontoon game. To make this into a full game, you would need to implement logic for betting, player actions such as hit or stand, dealer's actions based on house rules, and payout calculations.

Please note that in real games, insurance might also be an option when the dealer shows an ace, and there are other features like splitting pairs which can be implemented depending on your game design.
