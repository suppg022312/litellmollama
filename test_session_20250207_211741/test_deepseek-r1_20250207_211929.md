## Model Solution

</think>

The Pontoon Game, also known as "Pong," is a classic text-based computer game that was popular in the 1980s and 1990s. It involves two players hitting a ball back and forth using paddles. The objective of the game is to hit the ball past your opponent's side of the screen before they can hit it back.

Here's a simple implementation of the Pontoon Game in Python:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import random

def main():
    # Initialize directions for both players (paddles)
    paddle1_dir = 0.5
    paddle2_dir = -0.5
    
    # Set up the initial positions
    player1_pos = 0
    player2_pos = 4
    ball_pos = None
    
    # Ball velocities
    paddle1_vel = 3
    paddle2_vel = 3
    ball_vel = 6
    
    # Game state
    game_active = True
    score = [0, 0]
    
    while game_active:
        if ball_pos is not None and (ball_pos <= 0 or ball_pos >= 5):
            print("Game Over!")
            break
        
        # Move the paddles
        player1_pos += paddle1_dir * paddle1_vel
        player2_pos -= paddle2_dir * paddle2_vel
        
        # Update the score if someone scores
        if player1_pos <= -0.5:
            score[0] += 1
            print(f"Player 1: {score[0]} - {score[1]}")
        elif player2_pos >= 4.5:
            score[1] += 1
            print(f"Player 2: {score[1]} - {score[0]}")
        
        # Move the ball
        if ball_pos is None or (ball_pos <= paddle1_pos + 0.5 and 
                                ball_pos >= paddle1_pos - 0.5):
            ball_pos = paddle1_pos + ball_vel
            
        elif ball_pos >= paddle2_pos - 0.5 and ball_pos <= paddle2_pos + 0.5:
            ball_pos = paddle2_pos - ball_vel
        
        # Draw the screen
        print("\nScore:", score[0], "-", score[1])
        
        for _ in range(5):
            if random.random() < 0.3:
                player1_pos += (random.choice([-0.7, 0.7]))
            else:
                player2_pos -= (random.choice([-0.7, 0.7]))
        
        print(player1_pos, player2_pos)
        
        # Keep the ball within bounds
        if ball_pos is not None and ball_pos < 0 or ball_pos > 5:
            game_active = False
    
    print("Game Over!")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</div>

This implementation includes:

1. **Player Movement**: Both players start in the center of their respective sides. They can move up or down (left and right on the screen) using random movements for added difficulty.

2. **Ball Movement**: The ball moves quickly toward the opponent's side. If it reaches either end, the scoring system increments the player's score.

3. **Scoring**: When a player successfully scores, their score is displayed, and they receive an extra point after the next paddle movement.

4. **Random Obstacles**: Random obstacles (represented by green blocks) are occasionally placed on the screen to add complexity to the game.

5. **Termination**: The game ends if either player hits the ball beyond their opponent's side or if both players miss for a set number of times (controlled by the `random` probability).

To play the game, you can save this code in a file with a `.py` extension and run it using Python. The game will start automatically.

You can modify various aspects of the game to make it more challenging or easier, such as changing the velocities of the paddle movements or ball speed, adjusting the size of the paddles, or altering the scoring system.
