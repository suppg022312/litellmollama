## Model Solution

The Pontoon Game is a popular party game that is played with a deck of cards. The objective of the game is to be the first player to collect three cards in a row that are all of the same suit.

Here's how to play:

1. Shuffle the deck and deal out however many cards you want. Each player should receive at least three cards.
2. The player to the left of the dealer goes first, and then play moves clockwise.
3. To make a play, a player must either:
	* Play a card from their hand that matches the suit of the top card on the discard pile. If they do, they may also choose to "pontoon," which means they can add an additional card to their hand and place it face up on top of the discard pile.
	* Draw a card from the deck if they have no cards in their hand.
4. The game continues until one player reaches the target of three cards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. That player scores points and becomes the new dealer.
5. If a player reaches the target and is able to pontoon, they can add an additional card to their hand and place it face up on top of the discard pile.
6. The game continues until all players have played their cards and there are no more plays that can be made. The player with the most points wins the game.

The Pontoon Game is a great party game for people who enjoy card games and want a fun and exciting way to spend time with friends. It's easy to learn and can be played by players of all ages and skill levels.
