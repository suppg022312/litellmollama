## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python pontoon game
```
</div>

## Model Solution
Creating a Pontoon (also known as Black Jack) game using Python involves several steps including defining the deck of cards, creating player classes, implementing game mechanics like dealing cards and calculating scores, and finally running the game loop. Below is an example code snippet to get you started:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import random

# Define a Card class
class Card:
    ranks = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K']
    suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']

    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit

# Define a Deck class
class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = [Card(rank, suit) for suit in Card.suits for rank in Card.ranks]

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal_card(self):
        return self.cards.pop()

# Define the Player and Dealer classes
class Hand:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        self.value = 0

    def add_card(self, card):
        self.cards.append(card)
        self.adjust_for_ace()

    def adjust_for_ace(self):
        for card in self.cards:
            if card.rank == 'A':
                if self.value <= 11:
                    self.value += 11
                else:
                    self.value += 1

    def get_value(self):
        value = sum(card.rank != 'A' for card in self.cards) * 10
        for card in self.cards:
            value += Card.ranks.index(card.rank)
        return value

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.hand = Hand()

    def hit(self, deck):
        self.hand.add_card(deck.deal_card())

    def stay(self):
        pass  # No action needed for staying

# Game logic and main loop
def pontoon_game():
    players = [Player('Player'), Player('Dealer')]
    
    # Create a deck and shuffle it
    deck = Deck()
    deck.shuffle()

    # Deal initial cards
    for player in players:
        player.hand.add_card(deck.deal_card())
        player.hand.add_card(deck.deal_card())

    print("Game started:")
    for player in players:
        print(f"{player.name}'s hand: {player.hand.cards}")

    # Player turn
    while True:
        for player in players[0:1]:  # Only the first player (human)
            print(f"\n{player.name}, your turn. Type 'hit' or 'stay': ")
            command = input().lower()
            
            if command == 'hit':
                player.hit(deck)
                print(f"{player.name}'s hand: {player.hand.cards}")
                
                # Check for Pontoon (Blackjack) immediately after hitting
                if player.hand.get_value() == 21:
                    print(f"{player.name} has Pontoon! Winning.")
                    return

                # Check if bust
                if player.hand.get_value() > 21:
                    print(f"{player.name} busted!")
                    return
            
            elif command == 'stay':
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid command. Type 'hit' or 'stay'.")
        
        # Dealer's turn
        dealer = players[1]
        while dealer.hand.get_value() < 17:  # Dealer hits until it reaches at least 17
            dealer.hit(deck)
            print(f"Dealer's hand: {dealer.hand.cards}")

        # Compare hands
        player_values = [player.hand.get_value() for player in players]
        if max(player_values) == dealer.hand.get_value():
            print("It's a draw!")
        elif max(player_values) > dealer.hand.get_value():
            player_name = next((name for name, hand in zip(players, player_values) if hand == max(player_values)), None)
            print(f"{player_name} wins!")
        else:
            print("Dealer wins.")

# Start the game
pontoon_game()
```
</div>

This code provides a simple text-based Pontoon game. Players can hit (take another card) or stay (stop hitting), and the dealer follows its own rules to hit until it reaches 17 or more. The game ends when all players have completed their turns, and the hand with the highest value (without exceeding 21) wins.

**Important Notes:**
- This code doesn't include full error handling or input validation.
- It's designed for educational purposes to illustrate basic principles of creating a card game using Python.
- Ace is counted as 1 unless it can be 11 without going over 21.
- The game assumes each player only has one hand, which is common in text-based implementations but not necessarily how the actual Pontoon game (Blackjack) is played.

**Modifications and Extensions:**
You might want to enhance this code by adding:
- A betting mechanism
- Better input validation and error handling
- An option for players to split or double down
- A more sophisticated scoring system that distinguishes between different hands (e.g., pair, straight)
- A GUI for a more engaging player experience

Remember to test thoroughly as you extend the code.
