Creating an AI agent to automatically check your Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings and send you emails is a complex task, but I'll guide you through the basic steps and provide a simplified example using Python. You'll need to use the `python-office365` library to interact with Microsoft Outlook and potentially the `smtplib` and `email` libraries for sending emails.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install python-office365
   ```

2. **Obtain Necessary Credentials and Permissions:**

   - You'll need to obtain an Office 365 account with appropriate permissions.
   - Create an app registration on the Azure portal and get client ID, client secret, and tenant ID.
   - Install the `msal` library to handle authentication:

     ```bash
     pip install msal
     ```

3. **Python Code for the AI Agent:**

   Here's a basic example using Python and the `python-office365` library. Keep in mind that this is a simplified version, and you'll need to adapt it to your specific needs and handle errors more robustly in a production environment.

   ```python
   import office365.client_context as context
   from office365.outlook.meetingmessages import MeetingMessage
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   import smtplib
   from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
   from email.mime.text import MIMEText

   # Replace with your credentials and Outlook account information
   CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
   CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret'
   TENANT_ID = 'your_tenant_id'
   USERNAME = 'your_username@domain.com'
   PASSWORD = 'your_password'

   # SMTP server configuration (for sending emails)
   SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.example.com'
   SMTP_PORT = 587
   SENDER_EMAIL = 'your_email@example.com'
   SENDER_PASSWORD = 'your_sender_password'

   def get_upcoming_meetings():
       context = context.ClientContext(TENANT_ID)
       context. authenticate(USERNAME, PASSWORD)

       meetings = context.web. Calendars["Your Calendar Name"]. Items(
           minTime=datetime.now(),
           maxTime=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7),
           Subject="Meeting"
       )

       return meetings

   def send_reminder_email(meeting):
       subject = "Reminder: Upcoming Meeting"
       body = f"You have a meeting scheduled on {meeting.Start}: {meeting.Subject}"

       msg = MIMEMultipart()
       msg['From'] = SENDER_EMAIL
       msg['To'] = SENDER_EMAIL  # You can change this to the recipient's email
       msg['Subject'] = subject

       msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

       server = smtplib.SMTP(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT)
       server.starttls()
       server.login(SENDER_EMAIL, SENDER_PASSWORD)
       text = msg.as_string()
       server.sendmail(SENDER_EMAIL, [meeting.Subject], text)
       server.quit()

   def main():
       upcoming_meetings = get_upcoming_meetings()

       for meeting in upcoming_meetings:
           if isinstance(meeting, MeetingMessage):
               start_time = meeting.Start.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
               reminder_email = f"Reminder: You have a meeting scheduled on {start_time} with {meeting.Subject}"
               print(reminder_email)
               send_reminder_email(meeting)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

**Important Considerations:**
- **Security:** Storing sensitive information like passwords directly in code is not recommended for production environments. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to manage exceptions and handle failed authentication, network issues, etc.
- **Rate Limits:** Be mindful of API rate limits, especially with Microsoft's Office 365 APIs.
- **Privacy:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions and consider privacy implications when dealing with user data.

Remember that this is a basic example, and building a robust and secure solution will require further customization and testing.
