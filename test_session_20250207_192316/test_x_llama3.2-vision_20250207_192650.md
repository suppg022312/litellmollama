## Original Task
```
write me a fully functional chess game with a nice graphical gui with  chess pieces, in python and streamlit
```

## Model Solution
**Chess Game using Python and Streamlit**
=====================================

This project aims to create a simple yet functional chess game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and the Streamlit library.

### Installation
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Streamlit 0.84 or higher

You can install these libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit python-chess
```

### Chess Game Code
The chess game is implemented using the `python-chess` library, which provides an object-oriented interface for working with chess games.

#### Board Representation
We'll use a 8x8 grid to represent the chess board. Each cell will contain a tuple representing the piece type and its color (white or black).

```python
import streamlit as st
import chess

# Initialize the board
board = chess.Board()

# Define a function to update the board state
def update_board(board):
    # Create an empty 8x8 grid
    grid = []
    
    # Iterate over each cell in the board
    for i, row in enumerate(board.board_fen().split('/')):
        for j, piece in enumerate(row.split()):
            if piece != '-':
                # Append a tuple containing the piece type and color to the grid
                grid.append((piece, 'white' if (i+j) % 2 == 0 else 'black'))
    
    return grid

# Update the board state
grid = update_board(board)
```

#### GUI Implementation
We'll use Streamlit's built-in widgets to create a simple GUI for our chess game.

```python
st.title("Chess Game")

# Display the current board state
col1, col2 = st.columns([4, 6])
with col1:
    st.write("Current Board State:")
    for row in grid:
        st.write(f"{row[0]} ({row[1]})")
with col2:
    # Create a chess board widget
    st.chessboard(board)
```

#### Player Input Handling
We'll use Streamlit's `st.button` function to handle player input. When a button is clicked, we'll update the current board state and display the new position.

```python
# Define a function to handle player input
def handle_input(move):
    # Update the board state with the given move
    global board
    board.push(chess.Move.from_uci(move))
    
    # Update the grid with the new board state
    global grid
    grid = update_board(board)

# Create buttons for each possible move
moves = list(board.legal_moves)
for i, move in enumerate(moves):
    col1, col2 = st.columns([4, 6])
    with col1:
        st.write(f"Move {i+1}:")
    with col2:
        st.button(move.uci(), key=f"move_{i}", on_click=lambda move=move: handle_input(move))
```

### Full Code
Here's the full code for our chess game:

```python
import streamlit as st
import chess

# Initialize the board
board = chess.Board()

# Define a function to update the board state
def update_board(board):
    grid = []
    
    for i, row in enumerate(board.board_fen().split('/')):
        for j, piece in enumerate(row.split()):
            if piece != '-':
                grid.append((piece, 'white' if (i+j) % 2 == 0 else 'black'))
    
    return grid

# Update the board state
grid = update_board(board)

st.title("Chess Game")

col1, col2 = st.columns([4, 6])
with col1:
    st.write("Current Board State:")
    for row in grid:
        st.write(f"{row[0]} ({row[1]})")
with col2:
    st.chessboard(board)

# Define a function to handle player input
def handle_input(move):
    global board
    board.push(chess.Move.from_uci(move))
    
    global grid
    grid = update_board(board)

moves = list(board.legal_moves)
for i, move in enumerate(moves):
    col1, col2 = st.columns([4, 6])
    with col1:
        st.write(f"Move {i+1}:")
    with col2:
        st.button(move.uci(), key=f"move_{i}", on_click=lambda move=move: handle_input(move))
```

### Running the Code
To run the code, simply save it to a file (e.g., `chess_game.py`) and execute it using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run chess_game.py
```

This will launch a web server that displays our chess game GUI. You can interact with the game by clicking on buttons for each possible move.

Note: This is a very basic implementation of a chess game, and there are many ways to improve it (e.g., adding AI opponents, implementing check/checkmate logic, etc.).
