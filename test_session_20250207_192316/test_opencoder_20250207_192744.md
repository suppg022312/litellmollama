## Original Task
```
write me a fully functional chess game with a nice graphical gui with  chess pieces, in python and streamlit
```

## Model Solution
Here's a basic example on how you could start creating a chess game using Python and the Streamlit library:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

## Setup Instructions:
# Make sure to install the following dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal if not done already.
# The required libraries are: 
# Streamlit==0.67.1
# Numpy==1.19.2
# Pillow==7.2.0

## Example Usage:

# Run the app using streamlit
# `streamlit run chess_game.py`

# Chess Game Application - A very simple example

# Define board dimensions
BOARD_ROWS = 8
BOARD_COLS = 8
```

```python
# Initialize the chess board with empty strings for now
chess_board = np.empty((BOARD_ROWS, BOARD_COLS), dtype=str)

for i in range(BOARD_ROWS):
    for j in range(BOARD_COLS):
        chess_board[i][j] = ''

def display_board(board):
    # Function to print out current state of board
    for row in board:
        print(row)
    st.write('\n')

display_board(chess_board)

# Define pieces and add them onto the board here, then call display_board() again

# Example: Add a pawn on the board at position (3, 4):
chess_board[3][4] = 'pawn'
display_board(chess_board)
```

Please note that this is a very simple version of a chess game. A full implementation would require more complex rules for moves and checks, as well as handling of players' turns and checking if the game is over.

You could also make use of additional Streamlit features like sliders or checkboxes to allow users to interact with your game. 

The graphical GUI part was not covered in this example but you could utilize libraries such as `streamlit_elements` to incorporate more complex widgets into your chess game.
