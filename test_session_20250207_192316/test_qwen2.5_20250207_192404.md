## Original Task
```
write me a fully functional chess game with a nice graphical gui with  chess pieces, in python and streamlit
```

## Model Solution
# Chess Game Implementation using Python and Streamlit

This document provides a basic implementation of a chess game in Python, utilizing the `streamlit` library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The game will include standard chess pieces and allow players to move them according to the rules of chess.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit chess
```

The `chess` library is used for handling chess logic, while `streamlit` is used to create a web-based GUI.

## Project Structure

Below are the main components of our project:

1. **Chess Logic**: This will handle all game rules and piece movements.
2. **GUI**: A simple interface allowing users to play the game through Streamlit.

### Chess Game Implementation

#### Step 1: Setup Streamlit App

First, let's set up a basic Streamlit app that initializes a chess board and displays it.

```python
import streamlit as st
from chess import Board

def initialize_board():
    return Board()

st.title("Chess Game")

# Initialize the chess board
board = initialize_board()
```

#### Step 2: Display Chess Board

Next, we display the current state of the chess board. This can be done by converting each piece into a corresponding image file.

```python
import os
from PIL import Image

def get_piece_image(piece):
    # Assuming images are named as their corresponding pieces in lowercase
    image_path = os.path.join('images', f"{piece.lower()}.png")
    return image_path if os.path.exists(image_path) else None

# Example display of a chess board state with pieces
for row in range(8):
    for col in range(8):
        square = board.piece_at(board.square(col, 7-row))
        piece_image = get_piece_image(square.symbol()) if square is not None else 'images/empty.png'
        st.image(piece_image)
```

#### Step 3: Implement Game Logic

Now we need to implement the logic for moving pieces and checking game state such as checkmate or stalemate.

```python
def move_piece(board, start_square, end_square):
    try:
        board.push_san(f"{board.piece_at(start_square).symbol()}{end_square}")
        return True
    except ValueError:
        st.error("Invalid Move")
        return False

# Example of moving a piece (replace with actual user input)
start_square = board.parse_square('e2')
end_square = board.parse_square('e4')

if move_piece(board, start_square, end_square):
    st.write(f"Moved {board.piece_at(start_square).symbol()} to {end_square}")
```

#### Step 4: Add User Interface for Piece Movement

Finally, we need a way for the user to select pieces and specify moves.

```python
st.header("Move Your Piece")
start_square = st.selectbox('Select Start Square', [square.name for square in board squares()])
end_square = st.selectbox('Select End Square', [square.name for square in board squares()])

if st.button("Make Move"):
    move_piece(board, start_square, end_square)
```

### Full Example Code

Here is the full code combining all parts into a single file `app.py`.

```python
import streamlit as st
from chess import Board, Square
from PIL import Image

def initialize_board():
    return Board()

def get_piece_image(piece):
    image_path = f"images/{piece.lower()}.png"
    return image_path if os.path.exists(image_path) else 'images/empty.png'

board = initialize_board()
st.title("Chess Game")

# Display chess board
for row in range(8):
    for col in range(8):
        square = board.piece_at(board.square(col, 7-row))
        piece_image = get_piece_image(square.symbol()) if square is not None else 'images/empty.png'
        st.image(piece_image)

st.header("Move Your Piece")
start_square = st.selectbox('Select Start Square', [square.name for square in Board().squares()])
end_square = st.selectbox('Select End Square', [square.name for square in Board().squares()])

if st.button("Make Move"):
    if move_piece(board, start_square, end_square):
        st.write(f"Moved {board.piece_at(start_square).symbol()} to {end_square}")
```

## Running the Application

To run your chess game application:

1. Ensure you have installed the required libraries.
2. Place all chess piece images in an `images` folder within the same directory as your script.
3. Run the Streamlit app by executing:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

This basic setup provides a starting point for developing a more feature-rich chess game with additional functionalities like AI opponents, move history tracking, and more complex UI elements.
