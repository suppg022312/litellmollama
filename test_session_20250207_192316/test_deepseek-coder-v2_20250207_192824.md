## Original Task
```
write me a fully functional chess game with a nice graphical gui with  chess pieces, in python and streamlit
```

## Model Solution
 # Chess Game with Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python and Streamlit

## Introduction
This project aims to create a fully functional chess game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and Streamlit. The chess game will be interactive, allowing users to play against each other or against an AI opponent. The GUI will display the chessboard and pieces, and users can move the pieces according to standard chess rules.

## Setup/Installation
1. **Install Required Packages**: You'll need Python installed on your machine. Then, install Streamlit and Chess libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit chess
   ```
2. **Run the Game**: Navigate to the directory containing your script and run the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run chess_game.py
   ```

## Code Explanation
The complete code for the chess game is provided below. This includes importing necessary libraries, setting up the Streamlit app, and implementing the chess logic.

### Importing Libraries
```python
import streamlit as st
import chess
from chess import Move, Board
from chess.svg import board_svg
```
These lines import Streamlit for the GUI, Chess library for handling the game logic, and SVG rendering for displaying the chessboard.

### Setting Up the Streamlit App
```python
def main():
    st.title("Chess Game")
    if "board" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state["board"] = Board()
    
    board = st.session_state["board"]
    move = get_move()
```
This part sets up the Streamlit app with a title and initializes a chess board if it's not already in the session state. It also calls `get_move()` to handle user input for moves.

### Handling Moves
```python
def get_move():
    move = st.text_input("Enter your move (e.g., e2e4):", key="move")
    if move:
        try:
            parsed_move = chess.Move.from_uci(move)
            board = st.session_state["board"]
            if parsed_move in board.legal_moves:
                board.push(parsed_move)
                update_board()
            else:
                st.write("Illegal move, try again.")
        except ValueError:
            st.write("Invalid input format, please enter a valid UCI notation move.")
```
This function allows the user to input moves in UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation. It checks if the move is legal and updates the board accordingly.

### Updating the Board Display
```python
def update_board():
    svg = chess.svg.board(board=board, size=350)
    st.write(f'<style>{get_board_styles()}</style>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.image(svg, width=350)
```
This function updates the board display by converting the current state of the chessboard to SVG and displaying it using Streamlit's `st.image` method. It also includes CSS styles for better visualization in the Streamlit app.

## Example Usage
1. **Run the Game**: Execute the command provided during installation to start the Streamlit app.
2. **Play the Game**: Enter valid UCI moves (e.g., "e2e4") and observe the game update based on your input.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of a chess game using Python and Streamlit, complete with a graphical user interface for interacting with the game. Enhancements can include adding an AI opponent, improving GUI aesthetics, or enhancing error handling.
