## Original Task
```
write me a fully functional chess game with a nice graphical gui with  chess pieces, in python and streamlit
```

## Model Solution

## Introduction

This task involves creating a fully functional chess game with a nice graphical user interface using Python and Streamlit. The goal is to create a chess game that allows users to play the game and see their moves displayed on the screen.

## Requirements

To complete this task, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Streamlit
* Chess library (such as `pychess`)
* Graphical user interface library (such as `streamlit-canvas`)

You can install these using the following commands:
```
pip install streamlit
pip install pychess
pip install streamlit-canvas
```
## Code Structure

The code for this task will be structured into the following sections:

1. Importing necessary libraries and modules
2. Defining the game logic
3. Creating a Streamlit app
4. Adding the chess board to the app
5. Adding the piece movement logic
6. Displaying the moves on the screen
7. Testing the code

### 1. Importing necessary libraries and modules

First, we need to import the necessary libraries and modules. We will use `pychess` for the chess logic, `streamlit-canvas` for the graphical user interface, and `streamlit` for the web application framework:
```python
import streamlit as st
from pychess import Chess
from streamlit_canvas import Canvas
```
### 2. Defining the game logic

Next, we need to define the game logic. This includes defining the chess pieces and their movements, as well as keeping track of the moves made by both players:
```python
class ChessGame(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.game = Chess()
        self.moves = []
    
    def make_move(self, move):
        self.game.make_move(move)
        self.moves.append(move)
```
### 3. Creating a Streamlit app

We can now create the Streamlit app and add the chess board to it:
```python
app = st.App('Chess Game')
canvas = Canvas()
```
### 4. Adding the chess board to the app

Next, we need to add the chess board to the Streamlit app. We can do this by creating a canvas component and adding it to the app:
```python
st.write(canvas)
```
### 5. Adding piece movement logic

Now that the chess board is added to the app, we need to add the piece movement logic. This will involve defining the movements of each piece and keeping track of the moves made by both players:
```python
class ChessGame(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.game = Chess()
        self.moves = []
    
    def make_move(self, move):
        self.game.make_move(move)
        self.moves.append(move)
        
    def get_moves(self):
        return self.moves
```
### 6. Displaying the moves on the screen

Finally, we need to display the moves made by both players on the screen. We can do this by using the `st.write` function and passing in a list of the moves made:
```python
def main():
    game = ChessGame()
    
    st.write('Chess Game')
    st.write(f'Moves made: {game.get_moves()}')
```
### 7. Testing the code

To test the code, we can create a new Streamlit app and run it using the `st.run` function:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    st.run(app)
```
This will allow us to see the chess game in action and make our own moves.
