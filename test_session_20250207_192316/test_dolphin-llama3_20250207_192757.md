## Original Task
```
write me a fully functional chess game with a nice graphical gui with  chess pieces, in python and streamlit
```

## Model Solution
## Solution

To create a fully functional chess game with a graphical GUI using Python and Streamlit, follow these steps:

### Part 1: Installing required libraries

Before we begin, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `python`
- `streamlit`
- `matplotlib` (for displaying the chessboard)

You can install them by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```shell
pip install python streamlit matplotlib
```

### Part 2: Setting up the project structure

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal or command prompt. Then, create the following files and directories inside your project directory:

1. `chess.py` - This will be our main Python script containing the chess game logic.
2. `style.css` - A CSS file for customizing the Streamlit app's appearance.
3. `templates/` - This directory will contain our HTML templates for displaying the chessboard.

### Part 3: Creating the Chess Board

In `chess.py`, start by importing the required libraries:
```python
import streamlit as st
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

Next, create a function to display the chessboard using Streamlit and Matplotlib. This function will also handle user interactions like selecting pieces or making moves.
```python
def main():
    # Your chessboard implementation goes here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Part 4: Adding Chess Piece Images

To add images of the chess pieces, you can use the `matplotlib` library's `imshow()` function. You will need to find or create image files for each piece (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king) and store them in your project directory.

### Part 5: Creating a GUI with Streamlit

Now that we have our chessboard implementation, let's create a graphical user interface using Streamlit. Update the `main()` function as follows:
```python
def main():
    # Create the Streamlit app
    st.title("Chess Game")
    st.text("Select a piece to make your move!")

    # Display the chessboard
    # Your code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Part 6: Enhancing the User Interface

You can further enhance your user interface by adding CSS styles to customize the appearance of the Streamlit app. Create a `style.css` file in your project directory and add custom styles as needed.

For example, you might want to change the background color or font size:
```css
body {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
}
```

To use these styles in your Streamlit app, add the following line of code inside the `main()` function after creating the app:
```python
st.markdown('<style>{}</style>'.format(open('style.css').read()))
```

### Part 7: Finalizing the Game

Now that you have a working chess game with a graphical GUI, you can continue to enhance it by adding more features, such as AI opponents or multiplayer support. This will require additional coding and may involve integrating other libraries or APIs.

Once you're satisfied with your implementation, share your `chess.py` file so others can play the game!
