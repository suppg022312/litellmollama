### Overview

This project creates a fully functional chess game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Streamlit, a Python library for building data-driven applications.

### Setup/Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

*   `streamlit` for creating the GUI
*   `python` for running the application
*   `pynput` for handling mouse and keyboard events (optional)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pynput
```

### Game Logic

The game logic is implemented using a combination of classes and functions. The `ChessGame` class represents the entire game, while the `Piece` class represents individual chess pieces.

```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, color, x, y):
        self.color = color
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class ChessGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = []
        for i in range(8):
            row = []
            for j in range(8):
                if (i+j) % 2 == 1:
                    row.append(None)
                else:
                    piece = Piece("white" if (i+j)%2==0 else "black", i, j)
                    row.append(piece)
            self.board.append(row)

    def move_piece(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        # Move the piece from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2)
        # This is a simplified implementation and does not handle all possible moves
        if self.board[y1][x1] is None:
            print("No piece at position", (x1, y1))
            return

        piece = self.board[y1][x1]
        self.board[y1][x1] = None
        self.board[y2][x2] = piece
        # Update the positions of adjacent pieces
        # ...
```

### GUI Implementation

The GUI is implemented using Streamlit. We create a layout with buttons for moving each piece, and we update the position of the piece when a button is clicked.

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

st.title("Chess Game")

game = ChessGame()

# Create a 8x8 grid to represent the chessboard
grid = [[None]*8 for _ in range(8)]

for i in range(8):
    col = st.columns(8)
    for j, piece in enumerate(game.board[i]):
        if piece is not None:
            col[j].markdown(f"[{piece.color}]{j+1}")
        else:
            col[j].empty()

def move_piece(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    game.move_piece(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    st.session_state.grid = [[None]*8 for _ in range(8)]
    for i in range(8):
        col = st.columns(8)
        for j, piece in enumerate(game.board[i]):
            if piece is not None:
                col[j].markdown(f"[{piece.color}]{j+1}")
            else:
                col[j].empty()

# Create buttons for moving each piece
buttons = []
for i in range(8):
    row = st.columns(8)
    for j in range(8):
        if game.board[i][j] is not None:
            button = row[j].button(f"Move {game.board[i][j]} to ({i}, {j})")
            buttons.append((i, j))
            button.clicked(lambda i=i, j=j: move_piece(i, j, i, j))

# Display the current state of the board
st.write("Current Board:")
for row in game.board:
    st.write(row)

```

### Example Usage

To run the application, simply execute the following code:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Create a new instance of the chess game
game = ChessGame()

# Display the GUI
st.title("Chess Game")
grid = [[None]*8 for _ in range(8)]
for i in range(8):
    col = st.columns(8)
    for j, piece in enumerate(game.board[i]):
        if piece is not None:
            col[j].markdown(f"[{piece.color}]{j+1}")
        else:
            col[j].empty()

# Create buttons for moving each piece
buttons = []
for i in range(8):
    row = st.columns(8)
    for j in range(8):
        if game.board[i][j] is not None:
            button = row[j].button(f"Move {game.board[i][j]} to ({i}, {j})")
            buttons.append((i, j))
            button.clicked(lambda i=i, j=j: print("Button clicked!"))

# Display the current state of the board
st.write("Current Board:")
for row in game.board:
    st.write(row)
```

This will launch a Streamlit application with a GUI representing an 8x8 chessboard. You can move pieces around by clicking on the buttons labeled "Move [Piece] to ([position])". The current state of the board is displayed below the GUI.

Note: This implementation is highly simplified and does not handle all possible moves, checkmates, or other game rules. It is meant to demonstrate a basic structure for building a chess game with Streamlit.
