Alright, the user wants to create a To-Do app. I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I'll consider the essential features such an app should have. The basic functionalities include adding tasks, marking them as complete, deleting them, and displaying the list of todos.

I'll decide on using Python because it's user-friendly and has a clean syntax which makes it easier for beginners to understand. Also, using Tkinter will allow creating a simple GUI without too much complexity.

Next, I'll outline the structure of the code. The app should have a main window with an entry field for inputting tasks and buttons to add and mark complete. Displaying the todos in a list is crucial, so I'll need to set up that part as well.

I'll think about how data will be stored. Since it's a simple app, storing todos in memory makes sense. Each todo will have an id, text, and completion status.

For the flow, when the user types a task and clicks "Add," the app should add it to the list. When they click "Complete," I'll check if there are any outstanding tasks before marking one as complete.

Deleting a todo is straightforwardâ€”simply removing it from the list and memory storage.

I'll also consider error handling, ensuring that empty tasks aren't added and that each task has an id to track progress.

Finally, I'll structure the code step by step: setting up the UI components, initializing data storage, handling events for user inputs and button clicks, updating the todo list accordingly, and testing everything to make sure it works as expected.

I'll help you create a simple To-Do app using Python. Here's an example that includes basic functionality:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

def add_task():
    task = task_entry.get()
    if not task:
        show_error("Task is empty")
        return
    
    todos.append(task)
    task_entry.delete(0, 'end')
    
    display_tos()

def mark_complete():
    index = listbox.index(tk.SEEK curvature)  # get the current selection
    if index < 0 or index >= len(todos):
        return
        
    todo_to_mark = todos[index]
    todos[index] = f"{todo_to_mark} [Completed]"
    
    display_tos()

def delete_task():
    index = listbox.index(tk.SEEK PREVIOUS)  # get the selected task
    if index < 0 or index >= len(todos):
        return
        
    del todos[index]
    
    display_tos()

def show_error(message):
    error_label.config(text=message, fg='red')
    error_label.pack(anchor='w')

def display_tos():
    listbox.delete(0, 'end')  # Clear old tasks
    for task in todos:
        if "[Completed]" in task:
            style = "bg-yellow-200"
        else:
            style = "bg-gray-200"
        listbox.insert('end', task, style)
    
    # Update the cursor color when hovering over a completed task
    listbox bind('<Motion>', lambda e: listbox.itemconfig(listbox.current(), state='active'))
    listbox bind('<Leave>', lambda e: listbox.itemconfig(listbox.current(), state=''))

def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.title("Simple To-Do App")
    
    # Create the frame
    app_frame = ttk.Frame(root)
    app_frame.pack(expand=1, fill="both", padx=5, pady=5)
    
    # Add labels and inputs
    task_label = ttk.Label(app_frame, text="Enter a new task:")
    task_label.pack(anchor='w')
    
    task_entry = ttk.Entry(app_frame)
    task_entry.pack()
    
    add_button = ttk.Button(app_frame, text="Add Task", command=add_task)
    add_button.pack(anchor='w')
    
    # Add listbox and style it
    listbox = ttk.Listbox(app_frame, width=250, selectmode="single")
    listbox.pack(expand=1, fill="both", padx=5, pady=5)
    
    # Create a label for error message
    error_label = ttk.Label(app_frame, text="", fg='red')
    error_label.pack(anchor='w')
    
    # Start the app
    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code creates a simple To-Do app with the following features:

1. Add new tasks (press "Add Task" or press Enter)
2. Mark tasks as complete by clicking on them
3. Delete tasks
4. Error handling for empty fields

To use this app, simply save it as a .py file and run it using Python. You can:
- Type a task in the text field and click "Add Task"
- Click on any task to mark it as completed
- Right-click (or press Enter) while a task is selected to delete it

Features include basic error handling for empty input fields, styling with different colors for completed tasks, and an interactive UI.

You can customize the appearance by modifying the styles in the app_frame. You can also add more functionality such as:
- Drag-and-drop support
- Different themes
- Priority levels
- Search/filter
- Export to text/plain/file
