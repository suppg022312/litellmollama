## Original Task
```
tell me how to create a python spaceinvaders game with python code 
```

## Model Solution
# Space Invaders Game Implementation in Python

In this guide, we will create a basic version of the classic "Space Invaders" game using Python and the `pygame` library. The game will feature a player spaceship that can move left or right to avoid incoming aliens, shoot bullets to destroy them, and keep track of score and lives.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You'll also need to install the `pygame` library if it's not already installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Setting Up Your Game Environment

Let's begin by initializing our game window and setting up some basic properties.

### Import Necessary Modules
First, import all necessary modules from `pygame`.

```python
import pygame
import random
import os
```

### Initialize Pygame and Create Window
Initialize the `pygame` module and set up a display window where your game will be drawn. Also, define colors and other constants that your game needs.

```python
# Initializing pygame
pygame.init()

# Setting up display
screen_width = 800
screen_height = 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# Colors
white = (255, 255, 255)
black = (0, 0, 0)

# Game caption and icon
pygame.display.set_caption("Space Invaders")
icon_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'space-invader.png') # Ensure you have an image file named 'space-invader.png'
pygame.display.set_icon(pygame.image.load(icon_path))

# FPS (Frames per Second)
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
fps = 60
```

## Game Classes and Functions

### Player Class
Create a `Player` class to represent the spaceship. This class will handle movement, shooting, collision detection with enemies, and drawing itself on the screen.

```python
class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.image = pygame.transform.scale(player_img, (50, 38))
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.centerx = screen_width // 2
        self.rect.bottom = screen_height - 10
        self.speed_x = 8
        self.lives = 3

    def update(self):
        # Move the player
        key_state = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if key_state[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.rect.x -= self.speed_x
        if key_state[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.rect.x += self.speed_x
        
        # Keep player on screen
        if self.rect.right > screen_width:
            self.rect.right = screen_width
        if self.rect.left < 0:
            self.rect.left = 0

    def shoot(self):
        bullet = Bullet(player.rect.centerx, player.rect.top)
        all_sprites.add(bullet)
        bullets.add(bullet)

class Bullet(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.image = pygame.transform.scale(laser_img, (6, 30))
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.centerx = x
        self.rect.bottom = y
        self.speed_y = -10
    
    def update(self):
        self.rect.y += self.speed_y
        if self.rect.bottom < 0:
            self.kill()

# Load images and sounds (you need to have these files in your project directory)
player_img = pygame.image.load('player.png')
laser_img = pygame.image.load('bullet.png')

all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group()
bullets = pygame.sprite.Group()

player = Player()
all_sprites.add(player)

## Game Loop

Now that we've set up the basic structure of our game, let's enter the main game loop where everything happens.

### Main Game Loop
The game loop continuously handles events, updates the state of all objects in the game (such as players and enemies), checks for collisions, and redraws the display window.

```python
running = True
while running:
    clock.tick(fps)
    
    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                player.shoot()
                
    # Update sprites
    all_sprites.update()

    # Draw everything
    screen.fill(white)
    all_sprites.draw(screen)
    
    # Flip the display so that our last drawings are shown on the screen
    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
```

## Conclusion

This basic implementation of Space Invaders allows for movement and shooting, with enemies and collision handling to be added next. You can extend this game by adding more features such as multiple levels, power-ups, and enemy ships that move and shoot back at the player.

Remember, a good way to learn is through experimenting, so try modifying and expanding upon this template to enhance your understanding of `pygame` and Python programming in general!
