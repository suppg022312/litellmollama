## Original Task
```
tell me how to create a python spaceinvaders game with python code 
```

## Model Solution
## Overview of the Space Invaders Game using Python Code

The task requires creating a python implementation of a classic arcade game, specifically "Space Invaders". We will explore how to create such a project by breaking it down into several key components.

Firstly, we need libraries that can handle graphics and animations. For this purpose `pygame` library is used which provides functionalities for handling games easily in Python.

## Step 1: Installation

To start with the development of our game using python code, you should install pygame module by running:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Step 2: Importing Required Libraries

We'll import required libraries at the beginning to get all functionalities ready for use within this project.

```python
import pygame as pg
import random
```

In our game, we might need some functions like `pygame.init()` which initializes everything, `pygame.quit()` that quit it and various other useful methods. So let's add these too:

```python
import sys

pg.init()
pg.quit()

# rest of the code goes here...
```

## Step 3: Defining Screenshots Dimensions 

We'll also define our screen width and height to know how big we want our game window.

```python
SCREEN_WIDTH = 640 
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480

# ...
```
## Step 4: Generating Space Invaders

Now, let's implement the core gameplay of "Space Invaders". First, make sure that you have a list where each space invader belongs to and define it. 

```python
invader_list = []
for x_pos in range(SCREEN_WIDTH):
    new_invader = pg.sprite.Sprite()
    new_invader.load('imageofaninvader.png')
    invader_list.append(new_invader)

# ...
```
## Step 5: Moving The Invaders

We'll implement a function to move the invaders.

```python
def invade_screen(group, direction, speed=0.1):
    for invader in group:
        if invader.rect.top > SCREEN_HEIGHT - int(invader.rect.height / 2) and not invader.rect.collidewith(screen):
            screen.blit(invader.image, (invader.rect.x, invader.rect.y))
        else:
            if direction == 'right':
                new_x_pos = x_pos + speed
            elif direction == 'left':
                new_x_pos = x_pos - speed
            
            invader.rect.x = new_x_pos
            print(new_x_pos)
```
## Step 6: Playing The Game

Now, we'll implement the core gameplay.

```python
running = True 
game_over = False 

# ...
```

We will also need a function to check if any space invaders are hit by bullets. We can do this in `check_invaders_bullets_hit(bullets)`. If one is hit then that invader is removed from our list and their sprite gets deleted.

```python
def check_invaders_bullets_hit(bullets):
    for bullet in bullets:
        if bullet.rect.y < -int(bullet.rect.height / 2) or not bullet.rect.collidewith(screen):
            continue
            
        bullet.rect.top -= speed 
        print(bullet.rect.top)

    invader_list = [invader for invader in invader_list if abs(invader.rect.x) <= SCREEN_WIDTH / 3]
```

## Step 7: Updating The Game

Update the game screen.

```python
def update_game_display(group, bullets):
    pg.display.update()
    
    # ...
```
### Example Usage:

Run `start.py` script to start your python Space Invaders project. Enjoy!

```bash
python3 start.py 
```

Make sure that you have all required files and folders in the same directory as this script.

This code represents a basic outline of how you can implement "Space Invaders" using Python, but it's not complete yet because we haven't added more features like collisions detection between bullets and space invaders or control inputs for players. You'll need to add these functionalities yourself if you want your game project fully functional.
