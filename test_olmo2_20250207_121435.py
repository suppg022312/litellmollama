Certainly! To achieve this, we will use Python along with the `pyoutlook` library to interact with your Outlook Calendar and send emails via `smtplib` or a more sophisticated solution like `python-mailer`. 

First, make sure you have `pyoutlook` installed. If not, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pyoutlook
```

Then, you can use the following Python script as a basic template for an AI agent that checks your Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings and emails you a reminder:

```python
import pyoutlook
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

# Your Outlook credentials
username = 'your-outlook-email@example.com'
password = 'your-strong-password'
cal_id = '{E1EFE7D2-FFFD-4C9B-A3B2-9B1EAC6CFD88}'  # Replace with your Calendar ID

# Function to send email
def send_email(to, subject, body):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = username
    msg['To'] = to
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
    
    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.office365.com', 587) as smtp:
        smtp.login(username, password)
        smtp.send_message(msg)
    print(f"Email sent to {to} with subject: {subject}")

# Main function
def check_cal_and_send_email():
    cal = pyoutlook.calendars[cal_id]
    meetings_in_next_24_hours = [meeting for meeting in cal.find_upcoming_meetings(start=datetime.now(), end=datetime.now()+datetime.timedelta(hours=24))]

    if meetings_in_next_24_hours:
        # Assuming you want a 2-hour reminder before each meeting
        reminders = []
        for meeting in meetings_in_next_24_hours:
            # Adjust the time to 2 hours before the meeting start
            remind_time = meeting.start - datetime.timedelta(hours=2)
            reminders.append(f"Meeting: {meeting.title} at {remind_time}")
        
        if reminders:
            to_email = 'your-email@example.com'  # Your email to receive the reminder
            subject = "Upcoming Meetings Reminder"
            body = "\n".join(reminders)
            send_email(to_email, subject, body)

# Run the function to check and send emails
check_cal_and_send_email()
```

**Important Notes:**

1. **Security**: Hardcoding your Outlook credentials is not recommended for production use. You may want to use environment variables or secure credential storage solutions.

2. **SMTP Configuration**: The SMTP server details and SSL configuration depend on your email provider. Office 365 typically uses `smtp.office365.com` with port 587 and SSL/TLS enabled. Adjust as necessary for your email provider.

3. **pyoutlook Compatibility**: `pyoutlook` may require additional setup or dependencies based on your Outlook version and configuration.

4. **Meeting Retrieval Limitations**: This script only retrieves meetings in the next 24 hours. Depending on your needs, you might want to adjust the time window.

5. **Error Handling**: In a production setting, add error handling and logging to ensure robust operation.

6. **Outlook API Usage**: Ensure you comply with Microsoft's terms of service when accessing and using data from their APIs.

This script provides a basic starting point for creating an AI agent to check your Outlook calendar and email reminders. Customize it further to meet your specific needs and preferences.
