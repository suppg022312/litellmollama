Okay, the user wants an AI agent written in Python that checks their Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings and emails them in advance. I need to break down how to approach this.

First, I should figure out what libraries are needed. Since they want to interact with Outlook, which is a Microsoft product, PyOutlook seems like the right choice because it allows accessing Outlook from Python. Also, they'll probably want to send emails after setting reminders, so using the smtplib library makes sense for sending emails.

Next, I need to outline the steps the script should take. The main tasks are: extracting meeting details from Outlook, checking if there are any meetings scheduled soon, creating reminders with due dates, and sending those reminders via email.

I'll structure the script into functions for each task. Extracting meetings is straightforward using PyOutlook's Calendar methods. Checking for upcoming meetings requires knowing when "soon" means—maybe within a week or two weeks from now. For each meeting, I'll get the title, time, and day, then format it as a string.

Creating reminders can be done by adding events to Outlook. Each reminder should have a subject, body, start time, and due date. Using datetime to calculate the due dates based on when the script runs seems logical—maybe setting a reminder two days before each meeting.

Finally, sending emails with these reminders using smtplib is essential. I'll loop through each meeting and send an email from the user's account.

I should also handle potential issues like Outlook not being installed or the API changing. Including error handling in the code will make it more robust.

Testing the script would involve running it on a machine with Outlook installed to ensure everything works as expected.

Here's a Python-based AI agent that checks your Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings and sends you reminders via email:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pyoutlook import Calendar, Message
import smtplib

def check_outlook_calendar():
    # Initialize Outlook
    Outlook = Calendar()
    Outlook Connect("YourOutlookEmail@YourDomain.com", "YourPassword")

    # Get today's date and add a week to it (you can adjust the number)
    today = datetime.today() + timedelta(days=7)
    
    # Iterate through each meeting in the calendar
    for event in Outlook\Events:
        if event DTSTAMP:  # If this is a recurring meeting
            meeting_date = event.DTSTAMP
            if meeting_date < today:  # If it's already happened or in the past, skip
                continue

            # Extract meeting details
            title = event.Title
            time = event.Time
            day = event.DayName

            # Format the meeting information into a string message
            meeting_reminder = f"""
            Reminder: {title}
            Time: {time}
            Day: {day}
            """
            
            # Create a reminder email with due date
            reminder_email = f"""
            From: AI Agent Reminder <AI_Gent@Datacom.com>
            To: You <YourEmail@YourDomain.com>
            Subject: [Meeting Reminder] {title}

            Body:
            Hi {YourName},

            Here's your meeting reminder:

            {meeting_reminder}

            Looking forward to seeing you!
            """
            
            # Set the due date (e.g., 2 days before the meeting)
            due_date = meeting_date - timedelta(days=48)  # Adjust this based on your preference

            # Send via email
            try:
                server = "smtp.YourEmailProvider.com:587"
                port = 587

                # Create message object
                msg = Message()
                msg.AddTo("YourEmail@YourDomain.com")
                msg.Subject = f"Reminder: {title}"
                
                # Add body parts
                msg.Body = f"""
                Hi {YourName},

                Here's your meeting reminder:

                {meeting_reminder}
                """
                
                # Create event
                event = Message()
                event.To = "You@YourDomain.com"
                event.Subject = f"Reminder: {title} - Due: {due_date}"
                event.Body = f"""
                Hi {YourName},

                Here's your meeting reminder:

                {meeting_reminder}

                Reminder Sent From: AI Agent <AI_Gent@Datacom.com>
                """
                
                # Add the event to the message
                msg.AddEvent(event, due_date)

                # Send email
                with smtplib.SMTP(server, port) as server:
                    server.starttls()
                    server.sendmail("YourEmail@YourDomain.com", "You@YourDomain.com", msg.Body)
                    
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error sending email: {e}")

    OutlookDisconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace placeholders with your actual details
    print("Extracting Outlook Calendar...")
    check_outlook_calendar()
    print("Calendar checked and reminders sent.")
```

To use this script:

1. **Replace placeholders**: Fill in your email address, password, and other details (e.g., "You@YourDomain.com", "AI_Gent@Datacom.com").

2. **Outlook settings**:
   - Replace `Connect("YourOutlookEmail@YourDomain.com", "YourPassword")` with your actual Outlook account connection details.
   - Ensure the domain matches your Outlook email.

3. **Meeting due date adjustment**: Modify `timedelta(days=48)` to control when reminders are sent (e.g., set it to 2 days before the meeting).

This script does the following:
- Connects to your Outlook account
- Iterates through all events in the calendar
- Checks for meetings scheduled within a week of running the script
- Sends email reminders with due dates

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions and that the domains match. You might need to adjust the settings based on your specific setup.

To run this, save it as a `.py` file and execute it from a command line or terminal:

```bash
python outlook_reminder.py
```

Remember to install `pyoutlook` first if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pyoutlook
```
