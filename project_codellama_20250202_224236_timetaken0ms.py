I can help you with that! Here's an outline for creating a simple to-do list app using React:

1. Set up the project structure:
	* Create a new directory for your project and initialize a new npm project.
	* Install the necessary dependencies for your project, such as React, ReactDOM, and a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less.
2. Define the component hierarchy:
	* Start by defining the main components of your app, such as the App component that will wrap all other components, and the TodoList component that will display the list of todos.
3. Create the UI for your app:
	* Use React to create the user interface (UI) for your app, including the input field for adding new todos, the list of existing todos, and any additional features like filtering or sorting.
4. Add functionality:
	* Implement the logic for adding and removing todos, as well as updating their status (e.g., completed/uncompleted).
	* Use a state management library like Redux to store and manage the list of todos in your app.
5. Test and refine your app:
	* Write tests for each component and ensure that they are functioning correctly.
	* Refine your app's UI and functionality based on user feedback and testing results.
6. Deploy your app:
	* Once you have a working version of your app, deploy it to a hosting platform like GitHub Pages or Heroku.

Here is an example of how the code for the TodoList component might look like:
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const addTodo = (text) => {
    const newTodo = { text };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
  };

  const removeTodo = (index) => {
    const updatedTodos = todos.filter((todo, i) => i !== index);
    setTodos(updatedTodos);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>To-Do List</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            {todo.text}
            <button onClick={() => removeTodo(index)}>Remove</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <form onSubmit={addTodo}>
        <input type="text" />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This is just a basic example, and you will likely need to add additional functionality and styling as your app grows. But hopefully this gives you a good starting point for building your own to-do list app with React!
