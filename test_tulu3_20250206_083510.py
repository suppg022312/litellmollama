Creating a Space Invaders game from scratch requires substantial code and knowledge of game development concepts such as graphics handling (using libraries like Pygame), event handling, game loops, and more. Below is an extremely simplified version of what the core structure might look like using Python and Pygame to get you started.

First, ensure you have Pygame installed. You can install it via pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

Now let's start with a very basic implementation:

```python
import pygame

# Initialize the game
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
WIDTH = 640
HEIGHT = 480
SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# Ship settings
SHIP_SPEED = 5
ship_img = pygame.image.load("ship.png").convert()  # Load ship image
ship_x = WIDTH / 2 - ship_img.get_width() / 2

# Bullet settings
bullet_speed = 10
bullets = []
BULLET_IMG = pygame.image.load("bullet.png").convert()

# Alien settings (minimal implementation)
ALIEN_SPEED = 1
aliens = []

def draw():
    SCREEN.fill(BLACK)  # Fill the screen with black
    SCREEN.blit(ship_img, (ship_x, 430))  # Draw the ship

    for bullet in bullets:
        pygame.draw.rect(SCREEN, RED, (bullet[0], bullet[1], BULLET_IMG.get_width(), BULLET_IMG.get_height()))  # Draw bullets

    # Draw aliens here (minimal placeholder)

    pygame.display.flip()  # Update the display

def handle_events():
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE and not bullet_active:  # Simple spacebar to shoot
                bullets.append((ship_x + ship_img.get_width() / 2 - BULLET_IMG.get_width() / 2, 430))
                bullet_active = True

def update():
    global ship_x, bullet_active
    
    # Ship movement
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT] and ship_x > 0: 
        ship_x -= SHIP_SPEED
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT] and ship_x < WIDTH - ship_img.get_width(): 
        ship_x += SHIP_SPEED

    # Bullet movement (placeholder)
    bullets = [(x - bullet_speed, y) for x, y in bullets if y >= 0]

    # Alien movement (minimal placeholder)

    # Check for collisions (not implemented here)

# Game loop
running = True
bullet_active = False

while running:
    handle_events()
    update()
    draw()

    pygame.time.delay(50)
    
    for bullet in bullets.copy():
        if bullet[1] < 0: 
            bullets.remove(bullet) # Remove off-screen bullets
    # Close the game when the X is clicked
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

pygame.quit()
```

### What's missing?

- **Aliens**: We have a placeholder, but you'd need to define their positions, movement patterns, and collisions.
- **Collision detection**: Proper collision detection between the ship, bullets, and aliens needs to be implemented.
- **Graphics for aliens and bullets**: Replace placeholders with actual images (`"ship.png"` and `"bullet.png"`).
- **Sound effects and scoring**: Add features to enhance user experience.

### Extending Your Game

To fully create a Space Invaders game:

1. **Aliens Management**:
   - Create lists of alien positions.
   - Implement their movement patterns (linear, wave-based, etc.).

2. **Collision Handling**:
   - Detect collisions between the ship and aliens/bullets to implement damage, destruction, and scoring.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Show scores, lives remaining, and game over screens using Pygame's drawing functions.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Optimize performance by managing game loops effectively and reducing unnecessary calculations or redraws.

5. **Audio & Visual Enhancements**:
   - Add sound effects for shooting, collision, and power-ups.
   - Consider adding graphics effects like explosions.

### Further Reading

If you're new to game development with Python and Pygame, here are some resources to dive deeper:

- **Official Pygame Documentation**: [https://www.pygame.org/docs/](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
- **"Making Games with Python & Pygame" by Al Sweigart**: A great book that covers game development basics.
- **Online Tutorials and Courses**: Look for tutorials on YouTube or free online courses that focus on Pygame.

This simplified version provides a starting point, but creating a full-fledged Space Invaders game involves many more details and complexities. Keep experimenting, iterating, and learning!
