Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why my Gradio app is throwing this OSError about not finding an empty port. Let me see... The error message says it's on line 156 of http_server.py, and it mentions that it can't find an empty port in the range 7860-7860. Hmm, so it's only checking port 7860.

I remember that when setting up a server, you usually specify which port to use. Maybe I didn't set the right port or maybe it's already being used by something else. Let me check my environment variables. Oh, wait! The error suggests that if no port is specified, it tries 7860 first. So perhaps someone else is using that port.

I should try setting a different server port in the environment variables. Maybe I can set GRadio_SERVER_PORT=7861 or something like that. Also, adding http_num西装 to specify another port could help if the app isn't just using one port. That way, even if 7860 is taken, it'll try others.

Oh right, and in case the server doesn't start immediately, I should set up a loop to check periodically. Maybe use a while loop with a sleep statement until the server starts. That way, if it takes a bit to kick off, I don't have to wait manually every time.

Let me put this all together: modify the environment variables, update the code to handle multiple ports, and add a loop for retrying. I'll also make sure my code isn't using port 7860 by default if possible.

The error indicates that Gradio is trying to use port 7860 but it's already occupied. Here's how you can fix it:

1. **Set a different server port**
2. **Use multiple ports**

Here are the modified environment variables and code changes:

```python
# Modify your existing code before starting the server

GRadio_SERVER_PORT=7861  # Change to another available port
```

And update the server start section in your code:

```python
import os
from gradio.http_server import serve

def run_gradio():
    try:
        print(f"Running Gradio server on http://localhost: {os.getenv('GRadio_SERVER_PORT', '7860')}")
        serve(
            fn=your_function,
            server_port=os.getenv('GRadio_SERVER_PORT', '7860'),
            http_num西装=os.getenv('GRadio serving worker count', '4')
        )
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Server started on port {os.getenv('GRadio_SERVER_PORT', '7860')}")
        if os.getenv('GRadio_SERVER_PORT', '7860') == '7860':
            print("Port 7860 is busy, trying next available port...")
        # Try other ports
        for port in [7861, 7862, 7863]:
            try:
                serve(
                    fn=your_function,
                    server_port=port,
                    http_num西装=os.getenv('GRadio serving worker count', '4')
                )
                print(f"Server started on port {port}")
                return
            except OSError as e:
                continue
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_gradio()
```

**Steps to implement:**

1. **Update Environment Variables:** Change `GRadio_SERVER_PORT` to a different port number.
2. **Modify Server Start Logic:** Ensure the code tries multiple ports if the default one is occupied.
3. **Use http_num西装:** Specify additional worker ports if needed.

By making these changes, your Gradio application should start successfully on an available port.
