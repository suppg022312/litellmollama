## Model Solution

Create a C# Windows.net MVC Space Invaders Game
==============================================

Introduction
------------

In this task, we will create a simple C# Windows.net MVC game called "Space Invaders" using the Visual Studio IDE. This game will require users to move a spaceship left and right to avoid being hit by alien spaceships that are coming towards them. The game will also include power-ups that give the player additional lives or increase their score.

Setup
-----

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

* Visual Studio IDE (Community Edition is sufficient)
* .NET Framework (version 4.7 or later)

Once you have these prerequisites in place, create a new project in Visual Studio with the ASP.NET MVC template. Name the project "SpaceInvaders" and select ".NET Framework" as the target framework.

Creating the Game Board
-----------------------

The first step is to create the game board. We will do this by adding a new view to the "Views/Home" folder. Right-click on the "Home" folder, select "Add" -> "New Item...", and choose "ASP.NET MVC 5 View". Name the view "GameBoard" and click "Add".

In the "GameBoard.cshtml" file, we will add the necessary HTML and CSS to create a game board that looks like the following:
```css
<div class="game-board">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <div class="alien-ship"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
This will create a game board with a single row and column, containing an alien spaceship. We will use this element to display the game board in our application.

Creating the Game Controller
-----------------------------

Next, we need to create a controller that will handle the logic for the game. In the "Controllers" folder, right-click and select "Add" -> "Controller...". Name the controller "GameController" and click "Add".

In the "GameController.cs" file, we will add the necessary code to initialize the game board and start the game loop. We will also define a few actions that will handle user input and update the game state accordingly:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;

namespace SpaceInvaders.Controllers
{
    public class GameController : Controller
    {
        // Initialize game board and alien ships
        private List<AlienShip> _alienShips = new List<AlienShip>();

        // Initialize player ship
        private PlayerShip _playerShip;

        // Initialize power-ups
        private PowerUp _powerUp1;
        private PowerUp _powerUp2;
        private PowerUp _powerUp3;

        // Game state variables
        private int _score = 0;
        private int _lives = 3;
        private bool _gameOver = false;

        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult MoveLeft(string move)
        {
            if (_playerShip != null && !_gameOver)
            {
                _playerShip.Move(-1);
                UpdateGameState();
            }

            return View("GameBoard");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult MoveRight(string move)
        {
            if (_playerShip != null && !_gameOver)
            {
                _playerShip.Move(1);
                UpdateGameState();
            }

            return View("GameBoard");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult UsePowerUp(string powerUp)
        {
            if (_powerUp1 != null && !_gameOver)
            {
                // Handle use of power-up 1 here
            }

            if (_powerUp2 != null && !_gameOver)
            {
                // Handle use of power-up 2 here
            }

            if (_powerUp3 != null && !_gameOver)
            {
                // Handle use of power-up 3 here
            }

            return View("GameBoard");
        }

        private void UpdateGameState()
        {
            // Check for collisions with alien ships and update game state accordingly
            foreach (var alienShip in _alienShips)
            {
                if (CheckCollision(_playerShip, alienShip))
                {
                    _lives--;
                    if (_lives == 0)
                    {
                        _gameOver = true;
                    }
                }
            }

            // Check for collisions with power-ups and update game state accordingly
            foreach (var powerUp in _powerUps)
            {
                if (CheckCollision(_playerShip, powerUp))
                {
                    // Handle collision with power-up here
                }
            }
        }

        private bool CheckCollision(PlayerShip playerShip, AlienShip alienShip)
        {
            return (playerShip.X + playerShip.Width > alienShip.X && playerShip.X < alienShip.X + alienShip.Width && playerShip.Y + playerShip.Height > alienShip.Y && playerShip.Y < alienShip.Y + alienShip.Height);
        }
    }
}
```
This code initializes the game board, sets up the player ship and alien ships, and defines actions for moving left and right and using power-ups. It also includes a method to update the game state and check for collisions between objects.

Creating the Game Views
-----------------------

Now that we have our controller set up, we need to create the necessary views to display the game board and handle user input. In the "Views/Home" folder, create a new view called "GameBoard.cshtml". This view will contain the HTML and CSS for our game board:
```html
<div class="game-board">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      @if (_playerShip != null)
      {
        <div class="spaceship"></div>
      }
      else
      {
        <p>Loading...</p>
      }
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
This view will display a loading message until the game is started, and will show the player ship if it has been initialized. We will also add some CSS to make the spaceship look like an actual spaceship:
```css
.game-board {
  width: 100%;
}

.spaceship {
  background-color: #FFA500;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 2em;
  left: @_playerShip.X px;
  position: absolute;
  top: @_playerShip.Y px;
  width: 2em;
}
```
Next, we need to create views for the alien ships and power-ups. In the "Views/Home" folder, create a new view called "AlienShip.cshtml":
```html
<div class="alien-ship"></div>
```
This view will display an alien ship in the game board. We will also add some CSS to make it look like a real alien spaceship:
```css
.alien-ship {
  background-color: #8B008B;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 2em;
  left: @Model.X px;
  position: absolute;
  top: @Model.Y px;
  width: 2em;
}
```
Finally, we need to create views for the power-ups. In the "Views/Home" folder, create a new view called "PowerUp.cshtml":
```html
<div class="power-up"></div>
```
This view will display a power-up in the game board. We will also add some CSS to make it look like a real power-up:
```css
.power-up {
  background-color: #FFD700;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 2em;
  left: @Model.X px;
  position: absolute;
  top: @Model.Y px;
  width: 2em;
}
```
That's it! Now you have a fully functional space game that you can start playing. You can play the game by navigating to "http://localhost:5000" in your web browser and starting a new game. Enjoy!
