## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python chess game

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Creating a simple Python-based chess game is quite an endeavor but can be broken down into several steps. Below I'll outline how you could start building a basic text-based chess program in Python.

### Step 1: Understand Chess Rules

Before coding, make sure you have a solid understanding of the rules and mechanics of chess. You might want to refer to established references like [FIDE](https://www.fide.com/rules) for official rules or simpler explanations online.

### Step 2: Define Your Data Structures

You will need data structures to represent:
- **Board State**: A 2D list where each entry represents a square on the board and its piece (if any).
- **Piece Movements**: Dictionary or function that determines valid moves for each type of piece.
- **Game State**: Object containing current player, whose turn it is, if a game has ended, etc.

Hereâ€™s how you might start:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
class ChessPiece:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize board and pieces here
        pass
    
    def print_board(self): 
        # Function to print the current state of the chessboard
        pass

    def move_piece(self, from_square, to_square):
        # Validate and perform a move on the board
        pass

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = Board()
        # Initialize starting positions for pieces here
        
    def make_move(self, from_square, to_square):
        # Process player's move and apply rules
        pass
    
    def check_for_check(self):
        # Check if the current player is in check
        pass

    def check_for_checkmate(self):
        # Check if the current player is in checkmate
        pass

# Example of a Piece class for a simple Pawn
class Pawn(ChessPiece):
    def valid_moves(self, board, position):
        # Define moves based on chess rules here
        pass
```
</div>

### Step 3: Game Loop and User Interface

Your game will run in an infinite loop until the game ends:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def main():
    game = Game()
    
    while not game.is_game_over():
        # Print current board state
        game.board.print_board()
        
        # Get player input for move
        from_square, to_square = get_player_input()
        
        # Make the move on the board
        game.make_move(from_square, to_square)
        
        # Check for check, checkmate, or stalemate
        if game.check_for_check():
            print("Check!")
        elif game.check_for_checkmate():
            print("Checkmate!")
            break
        elif game.is_stalemate():
            print("Stalemate.")
            break
    
    # End of game logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</div>

### Step 4: Handle User Input

You'll need to handle user input, converting it into coordinates on the board:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def get_player_input():
    while True:
        try:
            from_row = int(input("From row (1-8): "))
            from_col = int(input("From col (a-h): "))
            to_row = int(input("To row (1-8): "))
            to_col = int(input("To col (a-h): "))
            
            # Convert alphanumeric column input to numeric
            from_col_mapping = "abcdefgh"
            to_col_mapping = "abcdefgh"

            from_square = from_row * 8 + from_col_mapping.index(from_col)
            to_square = to_row * 8 + to_col_mapping.index(to_col)

            return from_square, to_square

        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
```
</div>

### Step 5: Testing and Iteration

Once you have a basic framework in place, start testing individual components like piece movement rules, board printing, and user input handling.

Creating an entire chess game is complex and would typically involve many more considerations (e.g., castling, en passant, pawn promotion). This outline should give you a starting point. Remember to expand on each part iteratively; adding features such as AI opponents, graphics for visual representation, and more sophisticated endgame detection will enhance the gameplay.

This is just a simplified example to get started. For a more complex game with advanced rules or if you wish to include graphical elements, consider looking into libraries like [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), which can help in creating GUIs and visualizations for your chess game.

- **Chess Rules**: Official FIDE laws of chess.
- **Python Programming**: Python's official documentation and tutorials for beginners.
- **Game Development**: Tutorials and resources on game development with Python, including pygame. 

Good luck with your chess project!
