Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of an Expenses Form application using Python. This script will allow users to add, edit, and view expense entries.

```python
class Expense:
    def __init__(self, date, description, amount):
        self.date = date
        self.description = description
        self.amount = amount

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Date: {self.date}, Description: {self.description}, Amount: ${self.amount:.2f}"


class ExpensesForm:
    def __init__(self):
        self.expenses = []

    def add_expense(self, date, description, amount):
        expense = Expense(date, description, amount)
        self.expenses.append(expense)

    def edit_expense(self, index, new_date=None, new_description=None, new_amount=None):
        if 0 <= index < len(self.expenses):
            expense = self.expenses[index]
            if new_date:
                expense.date = new_date
            if new_description:
                expense.description = new_description
            if new_amount:
                expense.amount = new_amount

    def view_expenses(self):
        print("Expenses:")
        for i, expense in enumerate(self.expenses):
            print(f"{i}: {expense}")

    def total_expenses(self):
        return sum(expense.amount for expense in self.expenses)


# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    form = ExpensesForm()

    # Adding expenses
    form.add_expense("2023-01-15", "Groceries", 100.50)
    form.add_expense("2023-01-18", "Rent", 1500)

    # Editing an expense
    form.edit_expense(1, new_description="Utilities")

    # Viewing expenses
    form.view_expenses()

    # Total expenses calculation
    total = form.total_expenses()
    print(f"\nTotal Expenses: ${total:.2f}")

```

This Python code defines a simple `Expense` class to represent individual expense entries and an `ExpensesForm` class that manages these entries. The `ExpensesForm` allows adding, editing, viewing expenses, and calculating the total expenses.

To use this application:

1. **Add Expenses**: Call `add_expense(date, description, amount)` on your `ExpensesForm` instance.
2. **Edit Expenses**: Use `edit_expense(index, new_date=None, new_description=None, new_amount=None)`, passing in the index of the expense you want to edit and any updated values.
3. **View Expenses**: Call `view_expenses()` to print all current expenses.
4. **Calculate Total Expenses**: Utilize `total_expenses()` method to get a summary of total expenses.

You can run this code directly in your Python environment to test it out!
