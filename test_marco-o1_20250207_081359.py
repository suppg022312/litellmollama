<Output>
The error message indicates that Gradio is unable to find an available port within the specified range (7860-7860) to launch the server. This typically occurs when the desired port is already in use by another process or if there are not enough available ports in that range. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. **Check Port Availability**:
   - Ensure that no other application is using port 7860.
   - You can check which process is using a specific port with the command `netstat -tulpn | grep :7860` on Unix-based systems or `netstat -ano | findstr 7860` on Windows.

2. **Specify a Different Port**:
   - Modify your script to use a different port by setting the `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT` environment variable.
     ```python
     import os

     os.environ['GRADIO_SERVER_PORT'] = '8000'  # Replace with any available port
     ```
   - Alternatively, pass the `serv_port` parameter directly to the `launch()` function:
     ```python
     interface.launch(serv_port=8000)  # Replace with any available port
     ```

3. **Use a Different Range**:
   - If you prefer not to specify individual ports, ensure that your range includes multiple available ports.

4. **Restart the System or Service**:
   - Sometimes, forcefully stopping other applications using the desired port can free it up.
   - Alternatively, restarting your system might release occupied ports.

5. **Check for Port Conflicts with Docker Containers**:
   - If you're running Gradio within a Docker container, ensure that the host and container are not conflicting on the same port.
   - Use Docker's port mapping features to allocate different ports on the host machine if necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the port conflict issue, allowing Gradio to launch successfully.
