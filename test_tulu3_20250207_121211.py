To create an AI assistant capable of checking your Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings and sending you emails in advance, we'll use Python along with the `pyexchange` library to interact with Exchange servers (which is typically what Outlook uses). Below are the steps to set up such a system.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the necessary libraries:

```sh
pip install pyexchange
```

`pyexchange` allows you to access and manipulate data from Microsoft Exchange servers, including calendars and appointments.

### Step 2: Setting up Access to Your Outlook Calendar

To interact with your Outlook calendar using `pyexchange`, you'll need:

- **Your email address**: The account associated with your Outlook calendar.
- **Password**: For authentication purposes. **Note:** It's good practice not to hardcode credentials directly in the code for security reasons. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure secret management system.
  
### Step 3: Python Code Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you can set up an AI assistant that checks your Outlook calendar and emails you about upcoming meetings:

```python
import os
from pyexchange import ExchangeService, Account
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
import smtplib

# Function to check the calendar and send reminders
def outlook_reminder(email, password):
    service = ExchangeService()
    
    # Configure your account details here (do not hardcode passwords)
    account = Account(email, password)
    service.credentials = account
    
    # Set up a filter for upcoming meetings, e.g., within the next 24 hours
    start_time = (datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=24)).replace(tzinfo=None)  # Tomorrow's date/time
    end_time = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)).replace(tzinfo=None)      # The day after tomorrow's date/time
    
    meetings = service.calendar_list()[0].get_appointments(start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time)
    
    # Set up SMTP details for sending emails
    smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port = 587
    sender_email = "your-email@example.com"  # Your email address
    password = os.getenv('EMAIL_PASSWORD')   # Use environment variable to store your password securely
    
    # Create the email content
    message = MIMEText("Upcoming meetings:")
    
    for meeting in meetings:
        message.attach(MIMEText(f"- {meeting.summary} at {meeting.start_time}"))
    
    # Set up the SMTP server
    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
        server.ehlo()
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, password)
        
        # Send the email
        recipients = [email]  # Email to send reminders to (in this case, your own address)
        subject = "Upcoming Meetings Reminder"
        message['Subject'] = subject
        
        server.sendmail(
            from_addr=sender_email,
            to_addrs=recipients,
            msg=message.as_string()
        )
    
    server.quit()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    email = "your-email@example.com"  # Your Outlook email address
    password = os.getenv('OUTLOOK_PASSWORD')  # Use environment variable for secure storage
    
    outlook_reminder(email, password)
```

### Notes:

- **Security**: Never hardcode passwords in your scripts. Store them securely using environment variables.
- **Email Setup**: Adjust `smtp_server`, `smtp_port`, and `sender_email` to match the details of your email sending service (typically this would be an SMTP server for your email provider).
- **Error Handling & Logging**: This script is a basic example. In production code, include error handling, logging, and possibly schedule the script to run periodically using a task scheduler.

Before running this script, ensure that:

1. The `pyexchange` library is correctly installed.
2. You have properly set up your environment variables for storing passwords securely (e.g., `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `OUTLOOK_PASSWORD`).

This Python script serves as an entry point for building a more sophisticated AI assistant capable of integrating with Outlook and automating reminders for upcoming meetings, tailored to your specific needs and scheduling patterns.

Please remember that the above example is quite basic and intended for illustrative purposes. For production-grade code, consider additional aspects such as handling OAuth 2.0 authorization for Exchange Web Services (EWS), dealing with multiple calendars, and potentially integrating with a more advanced task automation system like `Airflow` or `Cron`.
