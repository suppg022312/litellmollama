create me a python based asteroid game 

```
</div>

## Model Solution
<think>
Alright, the user wants to create a Python-based asteroid game. Let's break down what I need to do step by step.

First, I should consider the structure of a simple asteroid game. It typically involves a player-controlled ship, asteroids moving around the screen, and shooting mechanics. So, I'll need to set up the game loop, handle user input for movement and shooting, and update the positions of both the ship and asteroids.

I'll start by using Pygame since it's a popular library for creating games in Python. I'll initialize the Pygame display and set up the necessary colors and fonts.

Next, I need to define the ship and asteroid classes. The ship will have attributes like position, velocity, speed, and rotation. Asteroids can be represented as objects with their own positions, velocities, and movement direction. I'll also include a score system that increases when asteroids are destroyed.

For the game loop, I'll use Pygame's clock to control the frame rate. The screen will update at each frame, and events like key presses and mouse clicks will be handled to move the ship and shoot.

Movement for the ship involves handling the Throttle and Steering inputs. I'll calculate the direction based on the mouse position relative to the ship's center. Shooting is straightforward: when the fire button is pressed, a bullet is fired from the ship's current position.

Asteroids will be created at random positions and velocities, moving in random directions. They'll have a certain speed and lifetime before they disappear or are removed if they hit the screen edges.

Collision detection is crucial. I'll check each asteroid against the bullets to see if any collisions occur. When an asteroid is hit, it'll break into smaller pieces, increasing the score, and then be removed from the game.

I also need to handle game over conditions, such as when the ship goes off-screen or collides with an asteroid. The game will display a message indicating the final score and exit.

Testing each part incrementally is important. I'll start by setting up the basic structure, then add movement, shooting, asteroid spawning, collision detection, and finally the scoring system.

I should also ensure that the code is well-organized, with functions for each major task like handling input, updating positions, drawing elements, and checking collisions. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

Finally, I'll provide instructions on how to run the game and suggest possible enhancements for the user to consider, like adding sound effects or improving graphics.

I'll help you create a simple asteroid game using Python and Pygame. First, let's create a basic structure that handles ship movement, shooting, and asteroid spawning.

1. First, we need to set up our game environment:

```python
<write_to_file>
    <path>main.py</path>
    <content>
        import pygame
        from random import randint
        
        # Initialize Pygame
        pygame.init()
        screen_width = 800
        screen_height = 600
        screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Asteroid Game")
        
        # Colors
        BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
        WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
        GRAY = (128, 128, 128)
        
        # Font
        font = pygame.font.Font(None, 74)
        
        # Ship and asteroid settings
        ship_size = 40
        asteroid_speed = 2
        bullet_speed = 7
        
        # Game variables
        score = 0
        clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        bullets = []
        asteroids = []
        ship = {
            'x': screen_width // 2,
            'y': screen_height // 2,
            'velocity_x': 0,
            'velocity_y': 0,
            'angle': 0,
            'speed': 5,
            'thrust': 0
        }
        
        # Fire button
        fire_button = {
            'x': screen_width // 2 - 100,
            'y': screen_height // 2 - 50,
            'width': 200,
            'height': 50
        }
    </content>
