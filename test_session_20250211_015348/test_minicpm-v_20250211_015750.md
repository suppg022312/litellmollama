## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
create me a python based asteroid game 

```
</div>

## Model Solution
Sure! Here's some sample code to get you started with creating an Asteroid Game using Python and Pygame. This basic version of the game will feature two players, each controlling their own ship.

Firstly, ensure that `pygame` is installed on your machine by running `pip install pygame`. Then open a new file in your favourite editor (such as `nano`, `vim`, or `emacs`) and write:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Define constants for the game.
FPS = 60.0        # frames per second, typically FPS=30 on mobiles but FPS=60 is better here.

# Set up the window dimensions (width, height).
SCREEN_WIDTH = SCREEN_HEIGHT = 850

# Initialize a blank screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

pygame.display.set_caption("Pygame Simple Aritsom Game")

# Define game constants.
UP   = [0,-1]
DOWN  = [0,1]
LEFT  = [-1,0]
RIGHT = [1,0]

# Define a function for the players to move their ships according
def playerMove(playerShip,x,y,movement):
    if movement[0] == UP:
        y -= 5.0 * FPS # x is not changed as ship speed in Y direction will be constant.
    elif movement[0] == DOWN:
        y += 5.0 * FPS
    elif movement[0] == LEFT:
        x -= 5.0 * FPS
    elif movement[0] == RIGHT:
        x += 5.0 * FPS

# Initialize the player ships' positions.
player1ShipX, player1ShipY = SCREEN_WIDTH/2, SCREEN_HEIGHT/2-30 
player2ShipX, player2ShipY = SCREEN_WIDTH-screen_width//4 , SCREEN_HEIGHT/2+30 

# Main function
def main():
    running = True

    # Start a new game.
    score1 = 0;
    score2 = 0;

    while (running):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False

            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:

                playerMove(player1ShipX,player1ShipY,[LEFT,UP])
                
# This code will be run on execution
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
</div>

This sample has been created with Pygame. To create a proper game, you'll need to add more functionality such as:-

* Adding AI for the player 2.
* Keeping track of lives and health points (HP).
* Adding explosions when one or both players get hit.

I hope this helps!
