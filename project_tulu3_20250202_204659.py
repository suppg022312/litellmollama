Certainly! Below is a simple Python script using Streamlit to create an Expenses App. This application will allow users to input and view their expenses.

**Python Script:**

```python
import streamlit as st

# Title of the App
st.title("Expenses Tracker")

# Sidebar for selecting date range
date_range = st.sidebar.date_range("Date Range:", value=(0, st.date_input("Today")))

# User inputs for expense details
expense_name = st.text_input("Expense Name")
amount = st.number_input("Amount", format="$%.2f")
category = st.selectbox("Category", ["Food", "Transportation", "Shopping", "Entertainment"])

# Button to add the expense
add_expense = st.button("Add Expense")

# Display all added expenses
expenses_list = []

if add_expense:
    if expense_name and amount:
        expenses_list.append({
            "name": expense_name,
            "amount": float(amount),
            "category": category,
            "date": date_range[1]
        })
        st.write(f"Expense {expense_name} added on {date_range[1]} for ${amount}")

# Display the table of all expenses
st.subheader("Your Expenses:")
if len(expenses_list) > 0:
    st.dataframe(expenses_list)

# Saving data (for persistent storage, you may use a database like SQLite)
def save_expenses_to_csv(data):
    import csv
    with open('expenses.csv', 'a') as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=data[0].keys())
        if f.tell() == 0:  # Header only on first write
            writer.writeheader()
        for row in data:
            writer.writerow(row)

save_expenses_to_csv(expenses_list)

st.info("Note: For persistent storage, expenses are saved to 'expenses.csv'.")

# Streamlit allows you to run this app locally.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    st.run()
```

**How it works:**

1. **Title**: The application is given a title "Expenses Tracker".
2. **Sidebar for Date Range**: A date range selector in the sidebar allows users to select their desired date range.
3. **User Input Forms**:
   - `Expense Name`: User enters the name of the expense.
   - `Amount`: A numeric input field where users enter the amount spent.
   - `Category`: A drop-down menu for categorizing expenses (e.g., Food, Transportation).
4. **Button**: An "Add Expense" button to submit the entered details.
5. **Expenses List Display**: Displays all added expenses in a table.
6. **Saving Data**: The script also includes functionality to save the expense data to a CSV file named `expenses.csv` for persistence.

To run this app, ensure you have Streamlit installed (`pip install streamlit`) and then execute the Python script locally on your machine.

**Note:** This is a very basic implementation. For a fully functional application, consider adding additional features such as validation, user authentication, expense categorization logic, and perhaps integrating with a database for persistent storage instead of CSV files.

**Usage Instructions:**

- Install Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`) if not already installed.
- Run the script in your local Python environment using `python <your_script_name>.py`.
- Open your web browser to `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

This setup provides a good starting point for building out more complex functionalities as needed.
