To create an Asteroids game using Python and Streamlit, you'll first need to install the required packages. You can do this by running:
```bash
pip install pygame streamlit
```
Next, let's write a basic version of the game.
Firstly in your `__init__.py` file initialize `pygame` module as follows:
```python
import pygame
# Initialize PyGame and set up display settings
pygame.init()
width = 800
height = 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
```
Then create a function to generate asteroids. This will be done using the `pygame` module's `Rect` class:
```python
def create_asteroids():
    # Generate an asteroid by creating a rectangle and setting its position.
    ast_x = random.randint(0, width - 1)
    ast_y = random.randint(0, height / 2 + size/3) 
    return pygame.Rect(ast_x, ast_y, size, size), ast_x, ast_y
```
Then create the `Asteroid` class. It will use an instance of a rectangle that represents its position and rotation:
```python
class Asteroid(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = pygame.Surface((size, size))
        # ...
```
Now create the `AsteroidsGame` class. It will handle updating of game logic such as generating new asteroids and moving them:
```python
class AsteroidsGame(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self(ast_x1)
        self(ast_y1) = ast_y1 + random.randint(-size/2, size / 3)
```
Next create the `Bullet` class. It will be responsible for handling player shooting:
```python
class Bullet(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = pygame.Surface((50, 10))
        # ...
```
Finally in your main function create a `pygame` event loop. Run the game for a certain amount of time or until user exits.
```python
def run():
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    running = True
    while running:
        events = pygame.event.get()
        if events[pygame.K_F6]:
            return False # Stop game on F6 press event
```
This should create a basic version of the Asteroids game using Python and Streamlit. You can customize it further to add additional elements like player, score tracking etc.
Please note that this code is just an example and not fully functional. It lacks many essential features such as collision detection between bullets and asteroids or handling when bullet hits asteroid. To create a more complete version of the game you may need to extend these classes with additional methods or properties.
