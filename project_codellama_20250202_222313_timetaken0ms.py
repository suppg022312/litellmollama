I can assist you with creating a todo app. To get started, I'll need some information about the requirements of the app. Please provide me with the following details:

1. What is the purpose of the app? (e.g., personal use, group use, school project)
2. What features do you want to include in the app? (e.g., creating tasks, setting reminders, organizing tasks by category)
3. Do you have any specific design preferences or requirements for the app? (e.g., color scheme, font choice)
4. Are there any specific platforms or technologies you would like to use for the development of the app? (e.g., Android, iOS, React Native)

Once I have this information, I can begin assisting you with the development of your todo app.
