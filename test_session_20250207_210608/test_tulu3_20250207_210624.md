## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python cribbage card game
```
</div>

## Model Solution
Creating a Cribbage card game in Python involves several steps including defining classes for cards, hands, and the game itself. Below is an example code outline that can serve as a starting point for implementing a basic version of Cribbage:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import random

# Define a Suit class
class Suit:
    HEARTS = 0
    DIAMONDS = 1
    CLUBS = 2
    SPADES = 3

# Define Card class
class Card:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit

    def __repr__(self):
        suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
        ranks = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K']
        return f'{ranks[self.rank]} of {suits[self.suit]}'

# Define a Hand class (a list of cards)
class Hand:
    def __init__(self, cards=None):
        if cards is None:
            self.cards = []
        else:
            self.cards = list(cards)

    def add_card(self, card):
        self.cards.append(card)

    # Example method to count points in a hand
    def count_points(self):
        pass  # This would be where you implement the point counting logic

# Define Game class
class CribbageGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.deck = self.create_deck()
        random.shuffle(self.deck)
        self.players = []  # Add players here, e.g., ['Player1', 'Player2']

    @staticmethod
    def create_deck():
        suits = [Suit.HEARTS, Suit.DIAMONDS, Suit.CLUBS, Suit.SPADES]
        ranks = list(range(13)) * 4  # 13 ranks (0-Ace) repeated for each suit
        return [Card(rank, suit) for rank in ranks for suit in suits]

    def deal_cards(self):
        # Deal cards to players (example implementation)
        num_players = len(self.players)
        hand_size = 6  # Each player gets 6 cards initially
        for i, player in enumerate(self.players):
            player_hand = Hand()
            for _ in range(hand_size):
                player_hand.add_card(self.deck.pop())
            print(f"{player}'s hand: {player_hand.cards}")

    def play_game(self):
        # Game logic goes here
        pass

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = CribbageGame()
    game.players.append('Player 1')
    game.players.append('Player 2')

    game.deal_cards()

    game.play_game()  # Placeholder method, implement your own logic here.

```
</div>

**Important points to consider and extend:**

- **Point Counting:** Implement methods within the `Hand` class to count points according to Cribbage rules.
- **Game Logic:** The `play_game()` method is a placeholder; you need to implement the entire game logic including dealing, playing cards, scoring, etc., based on standard cribbage rules.
- **AI Assistance:** Since Tulu 3 can assist with programming tasks but isn't designed for real-time gameplay or complex AI strategies within this context, its role here is mostly in providing a structured starting point for developing the game itself.

This example provides a skeleton structure to get started. Implementing all of Cribbage's rules (e.g., counting points, scoring, play sequences) requires additional logic and careful adherence to cribbage's specific ruleset. 

**Further Considerations:**

- **GUI:** For an enhanced user experience, consider adding a graphical user interface using libraries like `tkinter` in Python.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for your classes and methods to ensure they behave as expected.

This foundational code gives you a starting point from which you can expand and customize to fit the full rules of Cribbage.
