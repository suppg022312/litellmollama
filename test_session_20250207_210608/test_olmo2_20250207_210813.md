## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python cribbage card game
```
</div>

## Model Solution
Creating a full-fledged Cribbage card game in Python would be quite extensive, but I can provide you with a simplified version to get you started. This example will cover the basics such as dealing cards and scoring some of the fundamental cribbage hands. For a complete and polished game, you would need to add more features like handling multiple players, the discard and pegging phases, AI opponents, and a better user interface.

Here's a rudimentary implementation that focuses on the scoring aspect:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import random

def deal_cards(num_players):
    """Deals cards from a standard 52-card deck to players."""
    cards = list(range(1, 53))
    random.shuffle(cards)
    hands = [cards[i:i+num_players] for i in range(0, len(cards), num_players)]
    return hands

def score_hand(hand):
    """Scores a cribbage hand using basic rules."""
    score = 0
    # Counting combinations of cards in the hand
    for card in hand:
        score += card  # Ace is worth 1
    if (hand.count(2) > 1) or (hand.count(3) > 1) or (hand.count(4) > 1):
        score += 2  # Four of a kind (but only 2 points)
    if hand.count(card) == 3 for card in set(hand):  # Three of a kind
        score += 3

    # Two cards adding up to 15
    fifteen_pairs = 0
    for i in range(len(hand)-1):
        if hand[i] + hand[i+1] == 15:
            fifteen_pairs += 2
        elif hand[i] + hand[i+1] == 10:
            fifteen_pairs += 1

    # Runs of consecutive cards
    runs = 0
    for i in range(len(hand)-1):
        if hand[i+1] - hand[i] + 1 == len(hand) - i - 1:
            runs += (len(hand) - i - 1)

    return score + fifteen_pairs + runs

def main():
    # Number of players
    num_players = 2
    hands = deal_cards(num_players)
    print(f"Player hands: {hands[0]} {hands[1]}")
    
    scores = [score_hand(hand) for hand in hands]
    print(f"Scores: {scores}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</div>

This script provides a very basic framework for dealing cards and calculating scores based on some cribbage rules. It doesn't include handling the Crib itself, pegging, or the full array of scoring possibilities in Cribbage like pairs, runs, flushes, and go.

To create a more complete game, consider expanding this with:
- A looped game structure where multiple rounds (hands) are played.
- Handling the selection of the Crib and scoring it separately from the players' hands.
- Implementing the rules for discarding and pegging points during the play phase.
- Including functionality for handling different number of players.
- A user interface for playing against an AI or other players.

For a more sophisticated version, you might want to explore libraries such as `pygame` for game UI or frameworks designed for card games. Remember that a complete game can be quite complex and would benefit from a more structured approach to design and implementation.
