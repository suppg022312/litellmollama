Cribbage is a traditional English card game that is often played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. It is a simple yet strategic game that can be enjoyed by two or more players. Below is an overview of how to play cribbage:

### Objective:
The goal of the game is to score the most points by creating "hands" that add up to the highest possible scores.

### Setup:
1. **Players**: 2–8 players.
2. **Deck**: A standard deck of 52 cards (Aces are worth 1 point, numbered cards are worth their face value, and face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10 points).
3. **Dealer**: The dealer deals the first round of cards.

### Dealing:
- Each player is dealt a certain number of cards based on the number of players:
  - 2–4 players: Deal 6 cards each.
  - 5–8 players: Deal 5 cards each.

### Gameplay:
1. **Playing Cards**: Players can play any card from their hand during their turn, except for the lowest rank (e.g., if the leader played a 3, players cannot play another 3).
2. **Cribbage Crib**: A "crib" is created by taking two cards of the same rank and placing them face down in the center of the table.
   - If no pair can be formed from the initial deal, the dealer flips over one card to create a new round of play.

### Scoring:
Points are scored based on combinations (hands) that add up to specific totals. The most common combinations are:
1. **Pairs**: Two cards of the same rank.
   - Score: 2 points × rank value.
     - Example: Two fives = 10 points.
2. **Runs**: Three or more consecutive cards in the same suit, starting from Ace (A) as either a high or low card.
   - **Sequence**: Three consecutive cards.
     - Score: 3 points × highest card's rank.
     - Example: 5–6–7 = 21 points.
   - **Bust Sequence**: Four or more consecutive cards.
     - Score: 4 points × highest card's rank if the sequence is exactly four cards (e.g., A–2–3–4 = 20 points).
     - If the sequence is five or more cards, it is considered a "run" and scores 5 points × the sum of all consecutive cards.
       - Example: A–2–3–4–5 = 15 points (sum of 1+2+3+4+5) × 5.
   - **wheel**: A sequence that starts with Ace (A), followed by 2, 3, 4, and goes up to King (K).
     - This can be treated as a 13-card sequence. Points are calculated based on the highest card in use during the round.

3. **Nobs**: The single lowest card played or led out of the crib.
   - If no one has a nob, it is considered "no nob" and scores zero points.
   - The highest rank leads the nob count.
     - Example: If 2 is led as the lowest card, each player adds two points for each 2 in their hand.

4. **Other Combinations**:
   - **Bingo**: Four of a kind (e.g., four 5s) = 10 × rank value (e.g., 40 points).
   - **Counting Out**: Three or more cards of the same rank.
     - If three cards, they are worth 3 points each.
     - If four cards, the highest card is added to the total.

### Scoring:
- Players score independently. Points from a single hand go to the player(s) with the highest individual count for that round.
- **Highest Rank**: The player who led the nob leads again in the next round.
- **Tie-Breaker**: In case of a tie, players add up their points and the player with the highest total wins.

### End of Game:
The game ends when all cards have been played or only one player has any cards left. The winner is the player with the most points.

### Variations:
There are several variations of cribbage, including "Riff Raff" (using four suits instead of six), "Bullit," and "Cribbage 7." However, the traditional rules remain the most popular.
