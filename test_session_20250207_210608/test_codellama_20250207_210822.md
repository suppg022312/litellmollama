## Model Solution

Cribbage is a classic card game that can be played with two to six players. The objective of the game is to score points by forming sets and runs of cards, while also avoiding the "crib" which is a set of thirteen cards dealt face down.

Here are the basic rules for playing cribbage:

1. The deck consists of 52 cards, without jokers.
2. The cards are played in suits, with each suit having its own rank order (Ace is highest, King is lowest).
3. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards, usually seven or eight, depending on the number of players.
4. The crib is formed by placing thirteen cards face down in the center of the table.
5. Players take turns drawing cards from the deck and forming sets and runs of their own cards.
6. Each set and run is worth a certain number of points, which are determined by the specific combination of cards.
7. The first player to get rid of all their cards goes again, and play continues clockwise around the table.
8. If a player forms a set or run that includes a card in the crib, they can place it aside with the other crib cards.
9. A player can also "steal" a crib card if they form a set or run of a different suit than the crib.
10. The game ends when one player has scored enough points to win.

There are many variations of cribbage, with different scoring systems and rules for forming sets and runs. However, the basic rules outlined above provide a good starting point for learning the game.
