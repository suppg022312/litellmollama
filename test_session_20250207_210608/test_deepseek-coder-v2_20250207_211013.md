## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python cribbage card game
```
</div>

## Model Solution
 Sure, I'll help you create a simple Python program for the Cribbage card game. Here is a basic implementation of the game that includes some scoring rules and can be played with two players. This example assumes you have a standard 52-card deck without jokers.

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
import random

# Define the suits and ranks
suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace']
deck = [(rank, suit) for rank in ranks for suit in suits]

# Function to deal cards
def deal_cards(num_players):
    random.shuffle(deck)
    hands = [[] for _ in range(num_players)]
    for i in range(5):
        for hand in hands:
            if deck:
                hand.append(deck.pop())
    return hands

# Function to calculate the score of a hand
def calculate_score(hand):
    values = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'Jack': 10, 'Queen': 10, 'King': 10, 'Ace': 11}
    score = 0
    for card in hand:
        rank, _ = card
        score += values[rank]
    
    # Check for pairs, runs, and flushes (simplified)
    if len(set(hand)) == len(hand):  # No duplicates
        return score
    elif len(set(hand)) == 2:  # One pair
        return score + 2
    elif len(set(hand)) == 3:  # Two pair or three of a kind
        return score + 6
    else:
        return score

# Main game loop
def play_cribbage():
    num_players = int(input("Enter the number of players (2 for two-player game): "))
    hands = deal_cards(num_players)
    
    # Show each player's hand
    print("\nYour hand:")
    for i, hand in enumerate(hands):
        print(f"Player {i+1}: {hand}")
    
    # Player 1 plays first (assuming the dealer is player 1)
    current_player = 0
    while True:
        if current_player == 0:  # Dealer's turn to play
            print(f"\nPlayer {current_player + 1} ('Dealer'), your hand score is: {calculate_score(hands[current_player])}")
        else:
            print(f"\nPlayer {current_player + 1}, it's your turn.")
        
        # Implement game logic here (e.g., scoring, playing cards)
        action = input("Do you want to 'draw' a card or 'stand'? ").lower()
        if action == 'draw':
            hands[current_player].append(deck.pop())
            print(f"Player {current_player + 1} drew a card.")
        elif action == 'stand':
            break
        
        current_player = (current_player + 1) % num_players
    
    # Calculate final scores
    scores = [calculate_score(hand) for hand in hands]
    print("\nFinal Scores:")
    for i, score in enumerate(scores):
        print(f"Player {i+1}: {score}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_cribbage()
```
</div>

This code provides a basic framework for playing a simplified version of the Cribbage card game. It deals cards to each player, allows them to draw or stand based on their hand's score, and then calculates the final scores. You can extend this program by adding more sophisticated scoring rules, multiplayer support, and graphical user interfaces.
