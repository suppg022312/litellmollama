## Original Task
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```
python cribbage card game
```
</div>

## Model Solution
Programming a complete version of the classic cribbage card game in Python is quite complex and requires extensive understanding and knowledge about the game rules and concepts. Here's a simple basic implementation:

<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```Python
import random

# Define suits and ranks for cards
suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
ranks = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'Jack': 11, 'Queen': 12, 'King': 13, 'Ace': 14}

# Create deck of cards
deck = [(rank, suit) for suit in suits for rank in ranks]

def deal_cards(deck):
    # Shuffle and deal two hands of five cards each
    random.shuffle(deck)
    player1_hand = [deck.pop() for _ in range(5)]
    player2_hand = [deck.pop() for _ in range(5)]

    crib = deck[:3]  # The first three cards are the crib

    return player1_hand, player2_hand, crib

def score(hand):
    total_score = 0
    # TODO: Implement scoring logic here
    return total_score

def main():
    # Initialize game variables and deal hands of cards
    deck = [(rank, suit) for suit in suits for rank in ranks]
    player1_hand, player2_hand, crib = deal_cards(deck)

    # Display initial hands to players
    print("Player 1's hand:", player1_hand)
    print("Player 2's hand:", player2_hand)
    
    # TODO: Implement turns and scoring for each turn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</div>
This is a very basic structure of the game. The game logic (i.e., scoring rules), user input, and computer AI are not implemented in this code. To implement these features, you would need to add more functions and loops into the program.
