```
python cribbage card game
```
</div>

## Model Solution
Creating a Cribbage game in Python is an ambitious and rewarding project that involves understanding the rules of Cribbage, implementing the logic for dealing cards, scoring hands, and managing gameplay between players (or AI). Below is a simplified version to get you started. This example won't be fully functional but will provide a basic structure and some key functions.

### Basic Concepts:
- **Cribbage** involves 52-card decks with no jokers.
- Players can play as two humans, one human vs computer, or two computers.
- Each round consists of dealing six cards to each player.
- The players choose four out of the six to discard into a communal crib (the "crib" box).
- One card is turned up and used for scoring.
- Scoring happens based on combinations within hands.

### Key Steps in Programming Cribbage:
1. **Card Representation:** Representing cards using tuples or classes.
2. **Deck Management:** Implement shuffling, dealing, discarding.
3. **Hand Evaluation:** Evaluating the score of a hand based on cribbage rules.
4. **Game Logic:** Managing turns and scoring.

### Example Code:

#### 1. Card Class
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
class Card:
    SUITS = ('♠', '♥', '♦', '♣')
    RANKS = ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A')

    def __init__(self, suit: str, rank: str):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank

    @property
    def value(self):
        if self.rank in ('J', 'Q', 'K'):
            return 10
        elif self.rank == 'A':
            return 1
        else:
            return int(self.rank)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.rank}{self.suit}"

```
</div>

#### 2. Deck Class
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
from random import shuffle

class Deck:
    def __init__(self, cards=None):
        if cards is None:
            self.cards = [Card(suit, rank) for suit in Card.SUITS for rank in Card.RANKS]
        else:
            self.cards = cards

    def shuffle(self):
        shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal_cards(self, num=1):
        return [self.cards.pop() for _ in range(num)]

```
</div>

#### 3. Cribbage Hand Evaluation
This is a simplified version of hand evaluation logic:
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
def evaluate_hand(hand: list) pairs, runs = find_pairs_and_runs(hand)
    points = len(pairs) * 2 + sum(len(run) - 1 for run in runs)
    return points

def find_pairs_and_runs(cards):
    # A placeholder function that would need to implement finding pairs and runs.
    pass
```
</div>

#### 4. Game Class
<div class="code-container">
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
```python
class CribbageGame:
    def __init__(self, players=2):
        self.players = [Player(f"Player {i+1}") for i in range(players)]
        self.deck = Deck()
        self.turn = 0

    def deal_hand(self):
        self.deck.shuffle()
        hands = [self.deck.deal_cards(6) for _ in range(len(self.players))]
        # Discard two cards to the crib for each player
        self.crib = []
        for hand in hands:
            discards = input(f"{hand.owner}, discard 2 cards: ")
            self.crib.extend([hand.cards.pop(hand.index_of(card)) for card in discards])

    def play_round(self):
        # Play logic goes here, including scoring.
        pass

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```
</div>

### Notes:
- The code snippets provided are very basic and need expansion to fully implement the game rules.
- You'll need to implement functions for `find_pairs_and_runs`, `evaluate_hand` in a more complete manner, considering all cribbage scoring rules.
- Adding AI players would involve creating decision-making logic based on card probabilities and current scores.

This is just scratching the surface of what's needed for a full implementation. Cribbage involves complex scoring mechanics that would require thorough implementation to accurately reflect game play.
