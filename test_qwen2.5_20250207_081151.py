It looks like you're encountering an issue where Gradio is unable to start your server on port 7860 because that specific port might already be in use, or for some reason, Gradio isn't able to check it correctly. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this:

1. **Check if Port 7860 is Already in Use:**
   You can check which processes are using the port with commands like `lsof -i :7860` (on Unix-based systems) or use the command prompt on Windows to see if there's another process listening on that port.

2. **Specify a Different Port Manually:**
   Gradio allows you to manually specify which port your app should start on by passing it as an argument when launching the interface:

   ```python
   interface.launch(server_port=7861)
   ```

   You can replace `7861` with any other port number that you know is not in use.

3. **Using Environment Variables:**
   Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT` before running your script:

   ```sh
   export GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7862  # On Unix-based systems
   set GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7862     # On Windows command prompt
   ```

4. **Specify a Port Range:**
   Sometimes, specifying a range of ports can help Gradio automatically find an available port:

   ```python
   interface.launch(server_port=(7860, 7900))
   ```

This will allow Gradio to start your server on any port between 7860 and 7900 that is not in use.

By trying these methods, you should be able to resolve the `OSError` and get your Gradio interface running smoothly.
