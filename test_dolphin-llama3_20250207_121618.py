I'm happy to help! Here's a sample code using the `outlook` library in Python:

```python
import outlook

def get_calendar_events():
    # Set up your Outlook account
    credentials = outlook.get_credentials('<your_email_address>', '<your_password>')
    client = outlook.OutlookService(credentials)
    
    # Get calendar events for next week
    start_date = datetime.datetime.now()
    end_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=7)

    calendar_events = client.get_calendar_events('default', start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return calendar_events

def send_email():
    # Set up your Outlook account
    credentials = outlook.get_credentials('<your_email_address>', '<your_password>')
    client = outlook.OutlookService(credentials)

    # Compose and send an email with calendar events
    subject = 'Upcoming meetings'
    body = 'Here are your upcoming meetings:\n\n' + '\n'.join([event.subject for event in get_calendar_events()])
    message = outlook.Message(subject, body)
    
    recipients = ['<your_email_address>']
    client.send_message(message, recipients)

# Call the function to send email
send_email()
```

Replace `<your_email_address>` and `<your_password>` with your Outlook email address and password. This code will retrieve your calendar events for the next week and send you an email with those events. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
